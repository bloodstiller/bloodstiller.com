## Hack the Planet


Can you hear me? Is this thing on?

I’m Bloodstiller, an ethical hacker with a passion for security and privacy. My focus is on **Active Directory (AD) security**, working to protect enterprise networks and identity management systems.

I'm always exploring new techniques and keeping up with the latest threats. This blog serves as a way for me to share insights, tips, and experiences from my journey in hacking.

Currently, my primary focus is providing **Hack The Box walkthroughs**. These detailed guides not only help others but also deepen my own understanding of various concepts and attacks. Each walkthrough showcases my personal approach to solving challenges.

### The Goals of This Blog:
- Provide practical examples of ethical hacking techniques.
- Help fellow security enthusiasts improve their skills.
- Demonstrate real-world applications of cybersecurity concepts.
- Foster a community built on knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
- **Understand the concepts myself.**

### Realistic Troubleshooting, Bones And All:
My walkthroughs include all the troubleshooting steps I go through when things don’t go as planned. Many walkthroughs jump from point A to point B effortlessly, but the reality is often much messier—especially for beginners. I leave it all in, **bones and all**, to show the real process, and help set realistic expectations for those entering the industry or tackling CTFs.

Unfortunately, I’m just & I mean just, smart enough to know I’m dumb.
