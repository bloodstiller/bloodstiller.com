## Hack the Planet

Can you hear me? Is this thing on?

- I'm Bloodstiller, an ethical hacker intersted in security & privacy. I have a particular interest in Active Directory (AD) security, focusing on protecting enterprise networks and identity management systems.

- I'm constantly trying to explore new techniques and stay updated with the latest threats. With this blog my aims to share insights, tips, and experiences from my journey in hacking. 

- My main focus at the moment is providing Hack The Box Walkthroughs, as a means to help others but also further my understanding of the concepts & attacks themselves. These detailed guides showcase my approach to solving various challenges.

The aim of this blog is to:

- Provide practical examples of ethical hacking techniques.
- Help fellow security enthusiasts improve their skills.
- Demonstrate real-world applications of cybersecurity concepts.
- Foster a community of knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
- Understand the concepts myself. 
  - Unfortunately I am smart enough to know I am dumb.
