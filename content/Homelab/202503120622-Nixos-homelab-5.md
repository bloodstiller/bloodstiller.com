This is part 5 of my series demonstrating my rebuild of my homelab in NixOS.

-   Initial creation of the NixOSVM on Proxmox [Part 1](https://bloodstiller.com/homelab/20250220118-nixos-homelab/).
-   Enabling SSH access on NixOS [Part 2](https://bloodstiller.com/homelab/20250220118-nixos-homelab-2/).
-   Mounting a secondary drive on NixOS [Part 3](https://bloodstiller.com/homelab/20250280118-nixos-homelab-3/).
-   Decrypting boot early with initrd-ssh [Part 4](https://bloodstiller.com/homelab/20250280118-nixos-homelab-4/).
-   Installing Docker on NixOS [Part 5](https://bloodstiller.com/homelab/202503120622-nixos-homelab-5/) (This part)


## Overview: {#overview}

So far in this series we have setup the following:

-   A NixOS VM running on Proxmox.
-   SSH access to the VM.
-   A secondary drive mounted on the VM.
-   SSH access in early boot via initrd-ssh.

Which is great, but we are still missing a few things, namely Docker and other tools which will make this homelab complete. We will cover that in this article.


## Installing Packages: {#installing-packages}

 NixOS has a very easy way to packages. Again we are going to open `configuration.nix` file and add the following lines.


### Finding Packages {#finding-packages}

In our configuration.nix you can find a section that looks like the below

-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-03-12-064500_.png" >}}

This is where we can easily add programs we want to install.


#### Using search.nixos.org to search for packages: {#using-search-dot-nixos-dot-org-to-search-for-packages}

You can see at the top it says we can actually search for packages, by running `nix search [package]` however this only works if we activate experimental features which is out of scope for this article, instead we can use <https://search.nixos.org/packages> to search for packages.

-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-03-12-070843_.png" >}}


### Installing systemPackages in NixOS: {#installing-systempackages-in-nixos}


#### Step 1: Add the packages to configuration.nix: {#step-1-add-the-packages-to-configuration-dot-nix}

So lets install some packages, I am going to install the below packages, vim, acl, wget, git nfs-utils &amp; rsync, as you can see it's as simple as just adding the package name.

You may have also notices that these are listed under `systemPackages`, this means these will be available system-wide. It is possible to install packages on a per user basis &amp; use things like home-manager, but again that is out of scope for this article. See [Additional Note On Security:](#additional-note-on-security)

```nix
# List packages installed in system profile. To search, run:
  # $ nix search wget
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    vim # Do not forget to add an editor to edit configuration.nix! The Nano editor is also installed by default.
    acl
    wget
    git
    nfs-utils
    rsync
  ];
```

-   +Note+: Not all of these are required for this tutorial, however in later tutorials we will be mounting external nfs shares for docker to access and this will require modifying acls, also if you plan to version to control this or pull any external git repo's down I would also advise installing `git`

<!--list-separator-->

-  Additional Note On Security:

    I did consider installing these under user packages but elected not to for the following reasons:

    The security benefit is minimal for these particular utilities since they're common tools that don't introduce significant attack surface by themselves.

    -   For `vim, wget, git`, and `rsync`, there's minimal security difference between user and system installation.\*
    -   For `nfs-utils`, system-wide installation is beneficial since it typically involves system services that run as root anyway.

    +Note+: Please note I did not say there is "no security differences", there are minimal.


#### Step 2: Rebuild the system to install the packages: {#step-2-rebuild-the-system-to-install-the-packages}

Now that we have updated `configuration.nix` we now need to rebuild the system for our changes to be made.

```shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```


## Installing Docker on NixOS {#installing-docker-on-nixos}


### Preamble: What is Docker and Why Use It? {#preamble-what-is-docker-and-why-use-it}

If you're installing NixOS there is a good chance you already know what docker is, but for those who don't here is a brief overview

Docker is a platform that allows you to package and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Think of containers like lightweight, standalone packages that contain(see what I did there) everything needed to run a piece of software - the code, runtime, system tools, and settings. These run on top of the existing linux kernel in layers.

For a homelab, Docker is particularly valuable because it allows us to do the following.

-   Makes it easy to deploy applications without worrying about dependencies (everything is contained in the container)
-   Keeps different applications isolated from each other (unless we want them to talk to each other)
-   Allows us to easily update and manage services (we can update a single container, pin it to a specific version or just leave as is)
-   Provides a consistent environment across different machines (theoretically if I give you same docker configuration I have `compose.yml` it should be the exact same on your machine)
-   Makes backing up and moving applications between systems simpler (we can set persistent storage...remember that secondary drive we setup earlier?)

For a homelab, Docker will likely become one of your most-used tools for running services like media servers, monitoring tools, or web applications.


### Step 1: Basic Docker Installation {#step-1-basic-docker-installation}


#### Option A: Default Installation {#option-a-default-installation}

If you do not plan to use the secondary drive and are happy with the default location for docker, which is usually `/var/lib/docker` you can put the below in your config and run `nixos-rebuild switch`.

```nix
  # Enable Docker
  virtualisation.docker = {
    enable = true;
    };
  };
```


#### Option B: Custom Data Directory Configuration {#option-b-custom-data-directory-configuration}

You might want to change Docker's default data directory location for several reasons:

-   Better storage management: Keeping Docker data on a separate drive helps prevent your system drive from filling up
-   Performance: A dedicated drive (especially SSDs) can improve container performance
-   Easier backups: Having Docker data on a separate drive makes it simpler to backup and restore your containers
-   Space constraints: System drives often have limited space compared to secondary storage

If you plan on using the secondary drive, NixOS makes it easy to change where Docker stores its data. We just need to add the following information to our `configuration.nix` docker section:

```nix
  # Enable Docker
  virtualisation.docker = {
    enable = true;
    daemon.settings = {
      "data-root" = "/mnt/docker";
    };
  };
```

This configuration will store all Docker-related data including:

-   Images
-   Containers
-   Volumes
-   Build cache
-   Network configurations

This is one of the many reasons I love NixOS, the simplicity of the configuration.nix file is amazing, it is so easy to understand and modify. (don't get me wrong there are some things that are a bit tricky and that I still don't understand, but overall it is a very easy to understand and modify system).


### Step 2: Apply Docker Configuration {#step-2-apply-docker-configuration}

```shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```


### Step 3: Handling Docker Permissions {#step-3-handling-docker-permissions}


#### Understanding Docker Permission Errors {#understanding-docker-permission-errors}

If you try and run any docker commands right now they will fail with the below error, there are 3 ways around this error:

-   ![](/ox-hugo/2025-03-12-080519_.png)
    There are 3 ways around this error:
    1.  Run every docker command with `sudo`:
        -   Reason why we are not doing it: Running Docker commands with sudo gives those commands full root access to your system. This is dangerous because:
            -   A misconfigured container could gain access to your entire system
            -   Any security vulnerabilities in Docker could be exploited with root privileges
            -   Command history might expose sudo commands that could be misused
    2.  Install docker rootless on NixOS:
        -   I have never managed to get this to run successfully whilst exposing restricted ports.
    3.  Add our user to the docker group:
        -   This is the best solution for this specific use case so lets do that.
        -   While this still grants significant privileges, it's more controlled than using sudo
            and follows Docker's recommended practice for non-production environments.

+Note+: I am aware there are other ways to run docker containers within NixOS, declarativley as well as using other tools, however for these tutorials this is my preferred approach.


#### Adding User to Docker Group {#adding-user-to-docker-group}

Again we will be making changes to our `configuration.nix` file, in it you will find a section that looks like the below:

-   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2025-03-12-074401_.png" >}}

You can see that groups are added via the `extraGroups` list. So we just need to add `"docker"` to this.

```nix
# Define a user account. Don't forget to set a password with 'passwd'.
  users.users.martin = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    description = "martin";
    extraGroups = [ "networkmanager" "wheel" "docker" ];
    packages = with pkgs; [];
  };
```

-   +Note+: You may have also noticed that we can add user packages here but for this tutorial we don't need to.


#### Nerdy Nix List Fact: {#nerdy-nix-list-fact}

Nix has lists as a fundamental data structure, but +doesn't+ have a distinct "array" type as found in some other programming languages. So if you see the square bracket notation `[ ... ]` in Nix, it's always referring to a list.

Lists in Nix are immutable sequences of values that can contain elements of different types. The terminology distinction matters because Nix's type system is quite specific - it has lists, sets (attribute sets), and other primitive types, but not "arrays" in the traditional programming sense.


### Step 4: Apply User Changes {#step-4-apply-user-changes}

```shell
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```


### Step 5: Verify Installation {#step-5-verify-installation}


#### Activate Group Changes {#activate-group-changes}

If we try and run docker commands it still wont' work as the new changes are not reflected in the current shell, the easiest way to verify this is working is to logout and back in, once done you should be able to run docker commands.


#### Test Docker Installation {#test-docker-installation}

Lets run `hello-world` to verify it's all working.

```shell
docker run hello-world
```

As we can see it's working as expected.

## Conclusion/Next Time: 

You now have a system that has docker installed, in the next post we will actually create our docker compose file. 

## Sign-off: {#sign-off}

As always hack the ~~planet~~ homelab!
