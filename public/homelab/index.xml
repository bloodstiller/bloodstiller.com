      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-catalyst&#34;&gt;The Catalyst:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have stepped away from doing writeups for a little while, purely due to wanting to mix things up and the fact that I was just grinding for a year prior to get my CPTS certification; I actually have a number of writeups for active boxes written just not on the site due to the terms and conditions by HTB. And as I needed something else to spend my time with I created a Proxmox cluster using two nodes (I know I know you need 3 nodes for it actually be a cluster) &amp;amp; also set up a Proxmox backup server. However that took all of an hour to do, honestly, it was one of the easiest setups I have ever done (I will create a writeup for this soon enough.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
